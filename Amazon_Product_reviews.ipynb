It seems so many ya romance right now follow much the same formula only the names have changed (to protect the innocent ha!). And it was wonderfully different in setting and plot. It was very emotional and I could feel the characters pain. There were many good points. As I said, the plot was exciting and well thought out. The writing had a good flow. The chemistry between the h/h was out of this world. What truly wrecked it for me was that it did follow one very common formula in so many books I've read lately. The hero was so irrevocably in love with the heroine, that in the time it took to work their relationship out he slept with girl after girl. He was in so so much pain in his true love for her he had a terrible time keeping himself out of bed with any girl available! He even takes one home right in front of our girl! Yes, they were not technically &#34;together&#34; so you can't label him a cheater, but I'm really tired of reading this plot line. Oh, right - but they meant nothing to him! He loved - loved I say, our girl! Please authors, hear me NOW! This is not attractive. Yes, we want to have the hero proven to us to be sexy and irresistible but can someone please write me a book bf that has just a bit of honor? Do men really do this? As women, when we are in love - we don't want anyone else. All the men I have been blessed to know in my life that had some small amount honor seemed to feel the same way. So please, please stop this trend ! You ruined an absolute 4 to 4.5 star read for me.\n",

            "This book, which takes place between Blake Crouch's first and second books, deals with teenagers who are old enough to have strong memories of the world before coming to town and therefore have dreams of leaving without knowing why they can't - unlike the adults who are staying for their children and the young kids who do not remember another world. The main character, Carrie, is particularly interested in seeing what's beyond town, and Sheriff Burke has to keep her from the truth.

            "One of my favorite things about this book is that it's actually set during the school year. So many YA novels are summertime-themed (*cough*guilty*cough*) so it's refreshing to see one that actually deals with school, classes, and other aspects of a teenager's life. The MC, Wren, sets out on a mission to win the lead role in the school play, with nerves and ambitions like any other teenage girl, but on the side, her real passion is interior design/decorating. One of the coolest things about Wren is her liking for/talent in woodshop class. It's so opposite of everything girly, but it works for her, and it really plays into the depth of her character.Wren it put to the test after her aunt, the school's play director, quits - and she has to take over the school play. I don't want to spoil the book, but I loved the interactions between Wren and Derek. Their dynamic - within the realm of the play and outside of it - was great, and I loved how she tried to place her own feelings about him rather than assuming his reputation was legit. They weren't without conflict, but the ending of this book was incredibly sweet. If I had to find a word to describe this book, I'd go with &#34;cute&#34; because it's just adorable and fun and everything that contemporary YA novels should be. Wren's personal growth and accomplishments over the course of the novel along with well-rounded characters makes this a great read for YA fans of all ages!\n",

            "A copy of this book was provided by the author via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This review is courtesy of The Storybook KingdomThe second I read the X-Men comparison I was sold. You add in a murder mystery, and I am more than sold. Fortunetely this book delivered and I devoured it in less than a day.Tessa isn&#8217;t your normal 16 year old girl, she&#8217;s a Varient. She&#8217;s able to mimic the appearance of anyone she touches. Working for a secret government division Tessa is sent on her first mission. She&#8217;s to take on the life of the latest victim of a serial killer to find out their identity. Her mission turns out to more than she&#8217;s ready for as Tessa deals with secrets, lies, and being a teenage girl seeing what it&#8217;s like to be normal for the first time in her life.I loved everything about this book. It grabbed my attention from the beginning and held on to it until the very end. Tessa was incredibly easy to relate to even though she was dealing with not so everyday problems. She also had to deal with normal teenage feelings and problems along with the problems that came with being a Varient. Tessa, although unsure of herself, proves to be a braver and stronger as the book goes on. She&#8217;s determined to prove herself to prove herself and as agent and to not let anyone down. All of this just made Tessa even more likeable.The murder mystery held it&#8217;s own within the book. There were lots of twists and turns, and when I was positive I knew who the real killer was, I was entirely surprised. I couldn&#8217;t for the life of me figure out what the killer&#8217;s motive was until it was all revealed. I&#8217;m usually good at this stuff. I was a lot of crime dramas. The reveal was exciting,and I wasn&#8217;t sure how it was all going to turn out.As for Alec and his relationship with Tessa, I&#8217;m a bit on the fence about it. I feel like I didn&#8217;t get to know enough about Alec to really get a feel for him and his feelings for Tessa. I&#8217;m also confused about some of his actions toward her. Hopefully this will be resolved in the next book. Either way, I loved Tessa and the story enough to overlook it.If you&#8217;re looking for a combinations of X-Men, Veronica Mars, and maybe a bit of Criminal Minds then this is definitely the book for you. It so happens that I love all of those so this was definitely a book I loved. I can&#8217;t wait to see what happens to Tessa in the next book.\n",

Strong, sexy, skilled and stubborn, these men have a fight on for survival and 'Forgotten Sins' is Shane Dean's story and a fabulous introduction to the brothers and their plight.I devoured it.  With passion, action, fight and intrigue it's a busy book, but is paced well and flows perfectly. When Shane wakes up in a hospital bed with amnesia, the wife he left broken-hearted isn't quite so forgiving. Josie may be trying to forget their past, but he is hell-bent on remembering...Shane and Josie have a superb chemistry filled with passion, intimacy, suspense and surprises. Their journey is truly a captivating read and is touching and heartfelt with moments that make you smile. Shane's older brothers Matt and Nate play a large part and it is evident that there is much much more to come.  Thankfully I don't have to wait.A book I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.\n",

            "I say forgettable because, while reading this novel, I had faint recollections of virtually every passage, telling me I had read the story at some earlier period.  So, it's not a bad novel, it's just...forgettable.I do like the Windham family and I thoughtWorth Lord Of Reckoning (Lonely Lords Book 11)was a beautiful, beautiful story.  Also, the two stories of the duke and duchess.  I was all set to be crazy about this one, too.The family dynamics were entertaining and carried the story for me.  The story itself was okay, but plodding.  Anna's Big Secret made her look like a fool or a wimp; I can't decide.Note to author:  The incessant references to \"cold lemonade,\" \"iced...,\" were, no doubt, written to impress upon me, the ignorant reader, that this was a wealthy household.  Yes, yes, even I am aware of, \"...The rich have ice in the summertime...\"  You might consider that sometimes a whisper can be louder than a roar.  I rather resent being insulted by an author.Those who abhor anachronisms (coffee table...really?) may not enjoy this tale.  You must also be prepared for gallons of lemonade with LOTS of sugar (wealthy, you know,) and marzipan by the ton.  I waded through these obstacles in hopes of reading the same lyrical prose with which WORTH was written.  Alas, not to be.Fortunately, the author only descended into the *F* word a couple of times.  Neither scene was essential to the story, so I skimmed/skipped.  But why does GB, with her command of the language, feel compelled to swim in the gutter?At the end of the day, all that saw me through to the end were the accounts and dialogues of the family members.  And I wanted Gayle to somehow have a hea.\n",

            "I've become enamored of jelly rolls, recently. It means one less step in piecing quilts, speeding up the process; and it ensures that at least ONE part of the cutting-fabric-out process has been accurately done. But using the packages of 40 2.5&#34;-wide strips requires a specific design sense, and I've found the books by Pam and Nicky Lintott to be reliable guides. (Note that Amazon now carries some jelly roll fabrics, in case you're a long way from a quilt store.)This book has a fun premise, at least for those of us who want to make smaller quilts (e.g. small enough to comfortably quilt on a home sewing machine). You take one jelly roll, split it into two batches of 20 strips, add background fabric, and make two not-quite-related quilts. For example, the &#34;Playmates&#34; pattern creates a quilt that's 43&#34;x58&#34;, using 20 strips, 1.5 yards of fabric for sashing and border, and 16&#34; of fabric for binding. Its companion &#34;Fairy Steps&#34; is 47&#34;x54&#34; and uses 1.5 yards for sashing, borders, and binding.While the 18 designs in this book are essentially interchangeable (that is, all use 20 strips, not 17-and-23 or whatnot, which would leave you a few short), by making these in sets you can see the different moods created from the same jelly roll. For example, &#34;Spinning Tops&#34; and &#34;Train Tracks&#34; both use a jelly roll called &#34;Spring Fever;&#34; the &#34;Snapdragon&#34; and &#34;Fairy Steps&#34; designs are shown using a Moda jelly roll called &#34;Three Sisters Martinique.&#34; If nothing else, it helps me improve my &#34;Hmm, what would I do with that?&#34; design sense. (Even though some of the fabrics are not quite my own taste.)So far, I made one quilt, the aforementioned Snapdragon (with nine-patch blocks and snowball blocks). It has turned into a LOVELY baby quilt, at 38&#34;x50&#34; (or less; I decided against the outer border); I'd post a photo but the baby's mom hasn't seen it yet and we must keep SOMETHING a surprise. As it turned out, the roll I picked up at my local quilt shop was only half a jelly roll, so things actually worked out for the best. (Now I have no guilt about needing to do something with the other half a of a jelly roll.)If you have any experience quilting, the instructions are reassuringly easy to follow. (I would not choose this as my first quilting project, despite the relative ease of piecing, as the authors do take some knowledge for granted; but it'd be good for a third or fourth project.) The quilt top went together easily, in a happily puttery weekend project sort of way.The one disappointment with the Lintott's books is in the actual quilting. They do everything on a long-arm in an all-over design, and offer no suggestions on how to quilt the quilt. Among the reasons I'm so pleased with my Snapdragon is that I did a lot more quilting, beyond the basics (with a motif in the middle of each snowball block). I wish they offered more suggestions on the quilting side of things.Still, I'm glad I bought this book. I'm sure to make more quilts from it!\n",

I loved the back story on Slacket Demon and Kiro.Take a Chance was a great read but I can't get over the fact that I have to hang on this cliff for 7 months.  I love reading several books in a series with different characters as long as each book has completion.  I knew there was  a &#34;to be continued&#34; when I started reading and it stillmade me mad.  i definitely recommend reading this book but you may want to wait and read both together.\n",

            "&#34;Batman Beyond&#34; is a fun movie. It features Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, and she, the character and the actress, is always a big plus. As with some, but not all, of the current group of super hero movies, it gets too convoluted at times. I enjoyed it more the second time I watched it. Not just because she's pretty, but because she is an interesting and enigmatic character, and always has been from the first beginnings of her appearances, Catwoman should have been featured much more. Had I paid money to see this in a theater, I would have felt cheated, because it is so hard to follow. Having it at home, and being able to watch it more than once, I do think it's a pretty good movie.\n",

Highly recommended.The protagonist is an eighth grader who has lost her mother to an alien invasion.The book takes the form of an essay being written by the girl to explain what Smekday really means to her... The winner will have their essay included in a time capsule to be opened 100 years in the future.So Gratuity (&#34;Tip&#34;) Tucci begins her story.  She's funny, witty, and mature, while still having the light-heartedness and hopefulness of a, well, a middle-schooler.She first goes into the &#34;what happened&#34;... then the &#34;what next&#34; when her teacher urges her to include more personal reflection.Tip, her alien (Boov) compadre, &#34;J-Lo&#34; and her cat all set out to first save themselves and then to save the world.It's light, fun, quick, and cute. It's original, thoughtful, and funny. Well-populated by a wide variety of characters with their own personalities, this book is a gem that I'm glad I've discovered!Definitely recommend for elementary (high level) and middle school readers looking for something new...FOUR of five stars.\n",

In this epic slow burn love story, Erik again creates memorable characters and turns the reader's view of blind people into something to be remembered. A lot of us take sight for granted, but Erik captures the essence of blindness so completely, it's stunning. Combining that with his nearly legendary way of spinning a love story, it's truly a wonder and a work of art in itself.

            "You never know what you're going to get when you pick up a science fiction novel from an unknown author that you've never read  (or even heard of) before.  This book showed up on my recomended list from Amazon.  I read the brief write up and it sounded like something that I would enjoy. So I took the chance and purchased it.The books starts out well enough.  It's first half is very reminicent of some of the Steve Alten &#34;Meg&#34; novels.  Basically while searching for oil, scientists discover a hidden cave system three miles under the Earths surface. In that cave system lies an acient sea that has been completely separated and protected from the outside world.  And in this secret sea, we find another secret.....Predator X.The main character of the book is Megan.  The story is told from her perspective.  She is some sort of geologist and when the first team of explorers to the hidden sea turns up missing she jumps at the chance to join the rescue team.This book is great for two reasons.  First, Megan's character is so believable - both in her actions and in her dialog - that the story reads like a first person account of something that actually happened.  It gives the story a very &#34;real&#34; feel to it.  Second, about halfway through the book, the plot thickens......and then thickens some more.....and then more again.  What starts off as an unsuspecting fish story, blows up into a full-on science fiction romp.  By the time you get to the end of the book, you've completely given up on trying to guess what's happening next.  The ending is refreshing because it's not where you expect Waller to go with it.My only slight knock on the book is its title.  The story is so much larger than the surviving Pliosaur at the bottom of the prehistoric sea.  Maybe that was intentional on Waller's part so as not to give away the major plot twists hidden later in the book....but I can't help but feel that there is a better title out there for this one.  Regardless, this book is fun and absolutely worth the read for anyone who enjoys a good science fiction story.  I will absolutely read C.J. Waller again.  Very nicely done.\n",

            "The paranormal book is about Faes (empaths) and Lycans.  Ms. Charles has created a society of shifters who have their own government to help them exist in the human world in safety.  The pack mentality and laws are interesting and help shape the characters.  She makes you care about the heroes and loath the villains.  I must admit I am pretty good at figuring out a mystery.  I knew there was more going on but did not have it figured out correctly.  I loved that!  The love story between Eve and Rafe is good, conflict stated and then Damian is thrown in there to add a little dash of a love triangle.Nice to revisit some old friends from previous books.  Looking forward to last two books.  As stated in other reviews the books are free except the last one Road to Redemption, which is a continuation of Damian's story, for on 2.99.  Well worth the price.  Can't wait to read it.  He has a way of creeping into your heart. Would have paid for all after reading the first one.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes paranormal/werewolf genre.\n",

I really liked the flow of the book from &#34;lust at first sight&#34; to misunderstandings to growing up and finally to being with the one you love. There weren't much magic in this book so the title can be misleading but it's basically a story about a girl finding what she wants in life after a few bad dates and ends up with the one she should be with.Some parts were funny, some parts were sweet, and most parts I wanted to shout at the main character (Abby) to stop being so timid and say something to the guy she really loves.There were some parts of the book I glossed over as the details weren't that important to what I was reading, but I suppose the author put them in there to show the reader how Abby was growing up, learning, and owning up to it.So if you want a light yet detailed book about love, friendship, and growing up, I think you'll enjoy this book too.\n",

            "For the most part The Masked Heart follows the Regency romance formula: dashing, but jaded hero plus beautiful girl with a secret multiplied by familial obligations and complications = convoluted action leading to the inevitable HEA.  The exception in TMH is the unusual career choice of the heroine, Blaine, to become an actress to support her family.  Admittedly, I raised my eyebrow when reading this as acting would likely have been the next to last choice of a lady of quality in the Regency era.  To her credit the author, through Blaine's own ruminating, acknowledges this and still manages to make this plot device work.  Because of this I almost gave this story a 4 star rating.What earned it three instead of four stars is the authors tendency to have sticky and potentially dangerous situations work out too neatly and too easily with no attendant consequences.  I would have liked a little more tension.  I also felt that the author's choice of names for her central characters, Blaine and Drew, seemed a little too modern.  I realize that this may be a picky criticism, but I had that thought several times as I was reading.  All-in-all, it's not a bad read, it's just not a great read.\n",

            "As a fan of the sci-fi genre I'm impressed by the author's worldbuilding and the unique premise seen in this story.  From the vividly depicted variety of alien species to the advanced scientific technology it was easy to become immersed in this story.  As the first book in a series it laid some compelling groundwork for future stories that leave me excited for what's to come.Along with the intriguing and eye-catching scientific background there's a compelling and steamy romance between two very different people, people whose existence is frowned upon but have found a purpose in the military.  After the bloody end to her previous placement in a squad, the truth about Yoland was discovered and the importance of her ethnicity and the hormones she secretes leads to her being blackmailed.  She's chosen to be in a new squad that knows of how her previous assignment ended with each member going out of their way to ignore the potent pheromones she gives off, almost treating her delicately and brotherly.  Yoland is scared of the potency of the pheromones she gives off and dreads being touched because of the loss of control that overtakes her body.  It's hard to know what's real when her body so easily betrays her.  She can be seen as a strong-willed woman in most cases but when it comes to her genetics things are beyond her control and I ached for her in those situations.  Everyone wanted to take advantage of her hormones, from the scientists who wanted to collect her pheromones to combat disease to those men who tried to violate her.  Through it all, she had to keep the truth of her heritage hidden as it's illegal and places her family in jeopardy and lead her to doing whatever necessary to keep them safe.Dog is an intimidating man with his larger than life looks.  Behind these looks hides a man full of loyalty, a protector of the weak and downtrodden, someone honorable yet able to admit that when he sees something he wants he goes after it.  Yoland is exactly what he wants the moment he sees her and he unleashes a sensual onslaught to claim her.  He's a powerful man used to taking control and Yoland becomes his perfect match as his Alpha hormones call to her Prime ones.  At no time does he take her against her will as he's sworn to keep her safe and his honor won't let him sway.Theirs is a relationship full of twists and turns, as is the storyline and who's on the side of good and who has nefarious deeds in mind.  The romance is hot and nicely incorporated into the action that sometimes dragged though, especially early on.  There's a lot of characters introduced throughout the story that sometimes caused confusion, though some were immensely appealing and leave me wanting to see more of them.  Ultimately this was a satisfying story vividly depicting the best of what sci-fi can be.  The storyline was compelling and though there's completion at the end there's still room for more storytelling and I'm greatly anticipating what the future brings!\n",

            "Starting just over three years ago I spent two of those years losing 90 pounds.  I KNEW diets didn't work for me so I lost the weight by eating like a person of 'normal' weight.  I did however.....watch portion size.  I lost the weight pretty slow and did get an exercise bike which I've been on six days out of seven (min. 45 minutes).Six years ago I developed Grave's Disease which resulted in the loss of my thyroid.  Because of the loss of my thyroid I'm on synthetic thyroid - for the rest of my life.  Thyroid hormone controls metabolism and once I get stressed.....my metabolism goes off kilter.  This is where I've been for the past six months and I've regained 20 of my 90 pounds.  Last week I had the 'usual' blood test for thyroid level (TSH).  I'm on the low end but it's still acceptable to the medical community - regardless of how I feel (fatigued, little energy, and I don't want to do a thing!).  My level being low means I'm running a bit hyperactive - but OFF.....is OFF.  I feel crummy.  I'm also COLD - much of the day.Anyway......I'm desperate to get back to where I was and this book gives me hope but I'm just not sure how to execute a plan.  I don't want to go crazy with food but in fact keep myself to the plan of eating like a person of 'normal' weight.  For the past six months this has resulted in a weight gain (damn thyroid!).  When I see my Endocrinologist this May (they cannot see me before then - too booked-up) I'm planning to ask if I can change over to a natural thyroid medication - and get away from synthetic - hopefully.  I know the doctor won't like this but I've read enough about this subject and hope to give him a good argument on the matter.I've taken my waking temperature for a week and it averaged 96.8 - never over 97.  I'm going to take some of what this book professes and hope it warms me up AND helps my metabolism (which is sluggish at best and controlled by synthetic hormones).  As far as the stress factor?  I'm working on that and know in time, it'll resolve by itself.  Therefore; I must work on handling the stress better.Thank you Matt Stone.  You've put some fresh new ideas on the table.......and I'm ready for radical because 'scientific' approaches have never worked for me and I've spent a life-time with weight issues before being diagnosed with Grave's Disease.

I am in love with everything about this story!We have Teagan Moss, who is a human ambassador, as well as a kick-@$$ female, and in no way your typical damsel in distress.  Someone has taken her, strapped a bomb to her, and thrown her into the ocean, and that really pisses her off.  Thankfully, Ariston Dago (a Dagonite sentry) isn&#8217;t too far away, and is able to save her before she is swallowed up by the creepy creatures down below.There is an immediate connection between the two that neither can explain.  Ari doesn&#8217;t know why he&#8217;s feeling the way he is towards the human, but he will do whatever it takes to keep her safe.  Teagan tries to fight her feelings and focus on who tried to kill her and why, but those feelings soon prove to be too much to ignore.  Maybe just one round and she&#8217;ll have him out of her system?  Not with those talented tentacles, to say the least&#8230;I love the world the author created for us, and while everything was very different and there was a lot of new world to explore, she made it very easy to keep up with everything.  Eternal Echoes is a very action-packed, fast-paced story of love, destiny, politics, change, and a male and female lead that both kick @$$ and take names.

There are some minor problems with editing - a few missing words, wrong pronouns, etc..., but nothing that seriously detracts from the story. The lead characters are interesting, complex, well rounded people with the supporting characters contributing to the richness of the plot and the main character's lives as fully fleshed friends and family.The banter and chemistry between Sam and Mel is well written, as is the sarcasm. The love that Sam has for his uncle Tommy and vise versa is also well done-the two tough guys trying not to get too mushy. I absolutely loved Sam the ladies man's horror at being groped on the street by strange women in response to his \"Mr Right\" ads, and also Mel's barely concealed jealousy at the women who were doing the groping. I also loved the descriptions of Mel's dog and his pouting at being insulted. The best thing was the HEA, for more than one romance.There are sexual scenes but they're not overly drawn out or graphic, there isn't any violence and I don't recall any profanity.Heat factor moderate.\n",

Being born in Wisconsin and having parents who talked about Robin Yount and Paul Molitor, I was thrilled to discover that the novel focused on the Milwaukee Brewers.  This in and of itself drew me into the story despite its baseball focus.  I was thrilled as I read more and realized that one of the main character Mickey Tussler was exhibiting symptoms of autism. With a background in Special Education and a lot of experience working with Autistic children and adults, I genuinely enjoy working with and learning about individuals on the Autism Spectrum.  Two points of connection already had me won over, but as a read further and I saw the story take on the topic of segregation during the 1940&#8217;s and the struggle to concur it I knew that the book would be outstanding.I enjoyed this story so much that I read it in less than a day.

It offers a lot of the theory behind IF being a healthy way to eat, as well as practical information on starting this way of eating.  Really, who knows what constitutes a healthy diet?  Every week some study is published that claims to be THE HEALTHY HUMAN DIET. Come on!  When I was a kid butter was bad, eggs were bad, saturated fats were bad.  Now margarine is bad, eggs and butter are fine, red meat is great...Next week who knows what we will be told. With Intermittent Fasting, you learn to not eat because the clock says &#34;Meal Time&#34;.  For years I ate breakfast because all those &#34;experts&#34; kept saying it was the most important meal of the day.  I would routinely eat a meal I didn't even want because I had heard so many times how important it was!  Now I wait until I am actually hungry, usually at the usual lunch time, and I feel so much better all morning.  Read this book with an open mind, and give Intermittent Fasting a chance.  You may discover, as I did, that you feel much better with less food!  I also make better choices, because when I am truly hungry anything tastes good!\n",

            "I don't know but I gave up on King's novels by the late 1990's after being a true and loyal fan.  They gradually began to lack the same bone chilling suspense and nail biting horror that his past novels had. ( I guess his rehabilitation from alcoholism had a lot to do with it.  The novel even seemed to be an outlet for King to describe this part of his life.)  When I discovered he wrote a sequel to The Shining (one of the scariest books I read by him) I just could not resist the temptation to read it.  At first I was intrigued and enjoyed the first hundred pages but by the time I was well into the book I was beginning to pray that it would get better.  The climax just never peaked but fell flat and boring.  I was expecting the character of Rose the Hat to at least have the upper hand against Abra and Dan to add the usual anxiety and tension that King puts in his novels.  But I was disappointed to see that although Abra was a novice at her abilities, she managed to control and dominate Rose who had been around for centuries mastering her craft.  All the suspense that I had hoped would happen never did and I was left disappointed.\n",

She's learning more about the powers that she has and even going back to school to get her GED! However, she's not quite used to all the dead bodies piling up around her. Her contact at the Sans Francisco Police Department asks her to examine a dead body that is surrounding by bad luck charms. Lily finds the body of Malachi Zazi, whose father calls himself the Prince High and has formed a Devil religion. This is going to be a adventure of bad luck charms and devil-worshipping and Lily is going to need all her wits and friends!I don't read a lot of paranormal mysteries. I have a couple of series that I am completely devoted to and the Witchcraft Mysteries by Juliet Blackwell is one of them. I fell in love with this series when I listened to the first two books (Secondhand Spirits and A Cast Off Coven) on audio, with Xe Sands narrating. This is the first book in the series I've read in paperback form, rather than audiobook form, and I can confirm whatever format you choose this series is fantastic!I like Lily because she is very real. Yes, she's a fictional character, but Juliet Blackwell writes her so well, with flaws and talents, that I imagine she'd be someone I would encounter at my local vintage clothing store. Lily has had a very interesting childhood and alike to a onion, she has lots of layers and slowly we are starting to unravel the layers. In Hexes and Hemlines we learn more about Lily, her teacher, Aiden, the most powerful witch in Sans Francisco, Sailor, his psychic minion, and even Oscar, her familiar, who takes the form of a pot-bellied pig but is a goblin.The mystery is not just another murder for Lily to solve, but she learns more about the dynamics about Aiden and the witches and paranormals of Sans Francisco. I feel like there is still a lot more for us to discover about these characters and I can't wait to dig into the next book in the series.If you enjoy paranormal cozy mysteries with memorable characters then I highly recommend picking up Secondhand Spirits and making your way through this series. Long after you turn the last page you will be thinking about Lily and Oscar and wanting to take a visit back to their shop, Aunt Cora's Closet.\n",

            "David McCullough's account of the massive flood of 1889 that wiped out Johnstown, Pennsylvania, is accurate and objective without being dry. It is a gripping read. He covers the social and system failures that led to the catastrophic dam break and flood, but doesn't get carried away by trying to rewrite history, or play into stereotypes and social trends by casting blame on a small set of individuals. He examines in detail the various human errors, lack of foresight, and unfortunate changes in weather that led up to the dam break and washed away three towns in a day. More people died in Johnstown than died on the Titanic, and through a similar sequence of bad luck and bad decisions that make us shake our heads in hindsight and ask, \"Why?\" \"How?\" It was the perfect storm, and yet no-one remembers Johnstown as they do the Titanic. It should be remembered. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical non-fiction.\n",

She has always been an actress but something just doesn't feel right. So she decides to stop her life in the states. Go to Europe and just live. Little did she know she'll be finding herself and falling in love with the enigma Hunt.For months I've been debating on whether or not I should buy this in e-book form or the physical copy. Then the other I was browsing the book aisle at target and there it was a limited signed copy and I knew this is why I waited.. I'm so happy to have found this because I missed her book signing in February due to snow! :(This story is just amazing! I found myself laughing a lot, seriously smiling and kicking my feet in the air with happiness! Kelsey's an amazing character, but she also seems to contradict herself. She's hilarious, feisty, honest and confident.. But also extremely insure not physically but emotionally. She's the perfect mix of lost and broken. Where she'll still be able to live her life.. just not to her fullest extent. Until she meets Hunt. Who has to be thee most chivalrous character I've ever had the pleasure of reading about. I believed the species of gentleman were dead but for sure I am wrong. He's patient, kind hearted and mysterious. Oh and did I mention he's hot? Grey eyes. buzz cut, and muscles that belong on a bow flex commercial. The chemistry between them is pretty great. Though sometimes it came to a point where I just wanted to hit Hunt for being such a pansy! I found myself saying &#34;Oh c'mon.. Seriously?&#34; A lot.Overall,  I feel completely satisfied with the book. I love the way it began and ended. And obviously everything else in between ;) I won't be giving the book five stars because emotionally I couldn't connect with the characters. I loved that they are so dysfunctionally beautiful and I won't be reading 'Seeking Her'. (Prequel - Hunts POV) I definirely recommend the book if you've enjoyed the 'Losing it series' so far! :)\n",

            "Source : Netgalley / Publisher ARCRating : 4.2/5That title had me going. Circle here is a collective noun, so that should pique your interest. The book starts off with a funeral. Good-hearted, skilled plastic surgeon Dr. John Taylor has succumbed to a heart attack in a hotel room. Commanding the funeral is Deborah, his stoic wife of thirty-four years. Then a strange woman shows up to pay her respects. And another. Turns out they&#8217;re all wives of the deceased, only they were completely in the dark about the polygamy. Also hovering close by are the police; there is reason to believe that Dr. Taylor&#8217;s passing was not from natural causes.LaPlante tells the story in first person, from the point of view of each character, one chapter at a time. Each of the characters speaks about their life and relationship to the dead doctor. I loved this because it defines a character via varied points of view, each point of view embellishing a different facet. I get a deep-down portrait of the narrator, but then I also get a portrait of the other characters from the narrator&#8217;s point of view. So I know what Deborah is thinking, and then, I also know what Deborah thinks of MJ and Helen and Samantha. And this back and forth between different points of view is so skillfully done that it all fuses together seamlessly, like one big fantastic tale.I haven&#8217;t read LaPlante before, so am quite blown away by her writing. It is not that she winds her sentences a special way, or uses big words; she just has a way of getting to the heart of the matter, of baring her characters to us, by the way they walk and talk, the way they wear their hair, or obsessively mop up spills. A cardinal rule of story-telling is &#8220;to show&#8221; and not &#8220;to tell&#8221;. And I have to say, LaPlante excels at &#8220;showing&#8221;.Given the tabloid-y nature of the subject, this book could have gone south in the hands of a less accomplished author. With LaPlante&#8217;s considerable skill though, &#8220;A Circle of Wives&#8221; is a hard-to-put-down read.\n",

She was from a wealthy family that was looked down upon by the revolutionaries. When this event occurred, she was a brilliant young piano student. This became interrupted while she went through the brain-washing to accept the revolutionary thinking. She spent five years in camps to change her thinking. This was successful until she was older and could think rationally. Her status changed and eventually she got back to music and left China for a brief stay in the United States, but finally made her home in Paris. At the age of thirty, she became a concert pianist and discovered Bach's Goldberg Variations which she loved and played often. The writing is average, but the story is the star.

            "Typically for a Matthew Scudder novel, the opening chapter of HOPE TO DIE is compelling, suspenseful, just a little bit frightening, and of course, violent.  We learn what horrific events transpired in the home of the Hollanders, as they were met by two intruders who had just ransacked their home, and waited with relative patience for the duo to return so they could finish the job.Chapter one is a gift to fans everywhere of Matthew Scudder the man, as well as Matthew Scudder the Private Detective.  We hear his fears for the victims; we hear, too, his dreams and hopes and even beliefs for how their lives actually ended.  This section of the book is beautifully written; an almost overwhelming sense of loss and mourning pervades the opening chapter and leaves the reader feeling moved and possessing a sense of wonder as to how such strong emotions can be presented to the reader so quickly and with such apparent ease, using blank paper and only a few hundred words.And so it continues in chapter two.  The daughter is the one to find the bodies and naturally she is rescued; turned away from the infinite chasm of loneliness and life long trauma by her evening's date, who just happened to be decent enough to stick around after dropping her off to ensure there were no problems.Characters that long term readers of the series are familiar with, but rarely meet, are introduced again for the first time in the book shortly after as the plot takes an interesting turn.  It also makes a refreshing change for the story to escape (albeit briefly) the confines and classic noir-isms of New York City.The book's first stroke of genius comes with the story's return to the world's greatest metropolis at the end of chapter six.  Scudder hears an interesting theory concerning the daughter of the deceased couple and even though this theory falls flat on its metaphorical face, just the act of crossing town to hear it has got him to thinking.  Favours asked, and favours received, from connections in the crime fighting industry soon lead to unspoken thoughts and Scudder's own sets of theories as to who was behind the horrific murders.  And with TJ along for the ride, it's safe to assume that all bets are off when it comes to finding the disgusting sociopath.HOPE TO DIE is a classic example of the world class detective series we all know and love.  I won't reveal how it all ends here (obviously) and i would not recommend it as a starting point for those new to the series.  As i have said in other reviews of this amazing series, the books are so good they demand to be read in order.  Matthew Scudder's struggles with alcoholism, his wins and his losses all have to be read, lived, and experienced to be believed.  You owe it to yourself, to Scudder and even to Mr Block to walk in the footsteps of the great new age noir hero as he lives through each of these life changing events.Then you will see the truth.Matthew Scudder is a God.And YOU can be one of his disciples.BFN Greggorio!\n",

When Ridge convinces her to swap phone numbers, the two share their love of music together when he convinces Sydney to write lyrics for his band. It&#8217;s not until Sydney finds out her boyfriend of two years is cheating on her with her best friend, that she is left homeless with no place to go. Luckily for her, Ridge is there to step in and help by offering her a place to stay, however, writing music together can be a personal and intimate experience and they soon have to fight their attraction to one another because Ridge has a girlfriend...one that he won't leave ever. Can these two overcome their attraction to each other while trying to do the right thing, by not becoming unfaithful people?I have to be honest, if the opportunity hadn&#8217;t arisen to read Maybe Someday, I&#8217;m not sure I ever would have gotten to around to it anytime soon. And let me tell you what a big mistake that would have been, because then I would have missed out on this gem of a book.I'm even sure I can express how much I fell in love with this book. Colleen Hoover has written a remarkable book, that I know I won&#8217;t be forgetting for a long time. The way this story written is so heart achingly beautiful that I found myself completely enthralled with it until the very last page. Even now, weeks later, I still find myself thinking about this book because it&#8217;s like no other book I&#8217;ve read. It's definitely high on my re-read list. The reason I feel for this story so much was because I've just read nothing like it before. It's so unique and you can really feel how much heart and soul has gone into the writing of the story. The music aspect really makes it believable and gives you a strong connection to the whole story and the characters. I loved reading the lyrics to the songs and even better, you can actually listen online to the songs sung by Griffin Peterson. And I've listened to some of them, and they are so great and very beautiful because the lyrics are so real to the story.The story itself is not only based on music but also the growing relationship between Sydney and Ridge. The problem is that Ridge does have a girlfriend. Some people may be turned off by the fact that it&#8217;s kind of &#8216;cheating&#8217; book, but before you run away and say no, please believe me when I say read it. It's really not your typical &#8216;cheating&#8217; story where the characters completely disregard everyone&#8217;s feelings and just do whatever they want. No, this is a story about strength, compassion and dedication. Sydney and Ridge work so hard at not making any mistakes. They fight their attraction all the time. As a reader, you're rooting for them so you're just dying for something to happen between them, but you can also understand why it hasn't. The tension is unbelievably sizzling and then combine that with the connection the characters have, it's a tense story, one that's very unpredictable and emotional. And because the story is told from both characters points of view, you really are torn with what's right and wrong. You can feel and see the emotional turmoil they are going through.I absolutely loved Sydney and Ridge. They were two very strong characters that have tried to do the right things. They are both fierce characters and honest characters, and the way they interact with one another is something I won&#8217;t be forgetting for a long time. They open up to each other in many ways they haven&#8217;t with anyone else and their journey is just beautifully remarkable. Sydney was a girl that you could admire - she doesn't judge people and takes things as they are. She's very compassionate and loving and I believe she matched Ridge in every way. And by the end of the story, I was balling like a baby, it's pretty hard not tooAs you can see, I couldn&#8217;t fault Maybe Someday and honestly I&#8217;m glad I can&#8217;t. Colleen Hoover has written a beautiful story and combine that with Griffin Peterson's music, it's one of the best new adult books I've ever read. You simply can't miss out on this book, so I hope you read it too!\n",

The author explains, if you teach your children from a young age that happiness is not found in things they will carry that with them into adult hood.Learning to let go of the things I don't use in my life, has freed me, I feel happier in my home and no longer feel anxiety from the clutter that used to surround me.

            "I honestly have not followed a lot of Jim Korkis' blog posts.  I am still a print guy, so for me The Vault of Walt was pretty much all new material.  And there were some essays that I still often reflect on when mulling Disney history.  But with the original printing now out of print and the cheapest copies at the time of this posting starting in the mid $50 range, I just cannot recommend that edition.  Now fortunately it does appear that the price has been dropping thanks to the printing of The Revised Vault of Walt.  But the revised edition did not collect all of the original material.  Could a second volume of this series make all of the original content available at an affordable price?The Vault of Walt Volume 2: More Unofficial, Unauthorized, Uncensored Disney Stories Never Told by Jim Korkis continues in collecting his essays on Disney history.  Like the earlier versions this book is broken into four sections; Walt Disney Stories, Disney Film Stories, Disney Park Stories, and Other Disney Stories.  The essays are not connected and can be read out of order.  Essays printed before include: &#34;Santa Walt&#34;, &#34;Blackbeard's Ghost&#34;, &#34;Captain Eo&#34;, and &#34;Golden Oak Ranch&#34;.  New stories range from &#34;Walt and NASA&#34;, &#34;Secrets of the Santa Cartoons&#34;, &#34;The Birth of the Disneyland Jungle Cruise&#34;, and &#34;The Seven Snow Whites&#34; which show the diversity of the included essays.The Vault of Walt Volume 2 contains 15 new essays.  And honestly some of these essays caught my interest just with their titles matching some of my own personal interests.  I am a huge fan of Roy O. Disney so I enjoyed diving into &#34;Roy O. Disney: The Forgotten Brother Who Built the Magic Kingdom&#34; which does a great job of showing the elder brother's role in getting the Florida resort built.  And &#34;Walt's Chicago&#34; provides background to Walt Disney's relationship with his birthplace.  And of course in the wake of Saving Mr. Banks the essay &#34;Mary Poppins: Walt Disney and P.L. Travers&#34; delves into the story of Disney courting Travers and her opinion of the finished Mary Poppins.The stories themselves are generally short and clear.  They are easy to read and in many cases discuss a piece of Disney history not normally touched on.  It would be an easy book to enjoy on a number of train rides where you stop and start the text over and over again (which may be the way I read this volume).  The majority do read like detailed blogs, and those who have read them before may want more new content.  But I am someone who has only read these tales in the print format.  Yes, in the electronic age I was first exposed to these in a physical form.Let's look at the tale of the tape though.  There are two essays in the original volumes that I cannot find reprinted in The Revised Vault of Walt and The Vault of Walt Volume 2.  The  first essay, &#34;Song of the South Premiere&#34; has likely not been reproduced since Korkis now has in print Who's Afraid of the Song of the South which includes a chapter on the premiere.  The second essay, &#34;Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air&#34;, is a highly interesting essay on Mickey Mouse in the era of old time radio.  So for half the price of the original volume, you can buy The Revised Vault of Walt and The Vault of Walt Volume 2 and lose one essay with the trade off of 20 new ones.  Or one can buy the two Kindle versions for a fifth of the original's current used price.  So I think it is obvious the Between Books recommendation is to buy the two books instead of tracking down a used copy of the original.Fans of Jim Korkis will want The Vault of Walt Volume 2 in their collection.  Serious Disney fans will want this volume for the unique content found in its pages.  And those more casual Disney fans can find plenty of enjoyment within.  And best of all, nearly all of the originally printed essays can be purchased for a reasonable price!Review Copy Provided by Theme Park Press\n",

First, I was distracted throughout the story because of grammatical errors.  This usually does not bother me but all the semi-colons and commas in the wrong place, interrupting the flow of the sentences, made it hard for me to get into the story.  Second, I felt like there was too many side stories going on throughout which made it difficult to keep up.

            "I must admit, I feel conflicted about this book. On one hand, a lot of it was great - it was awfully close to getting 5+++ stars from me and being one of my ZOMG! wow! so good! favorite books. The writing is good, the sex scenes are HOT and the emotional intimacy makes a good go of being achingly poignant most of the time. And Max - wow, he's definitely one of my favorite romance heroes. He's so well done, he really comes to life and you really just LIKE him. A lot. And WANT him. ~rowr~But Sara, less so. I liked her well enough, I suppose, but I never loved her and I was frequently annoyed by her. There was something missing in her characterization. It kind of felt like this wasn't the final draft of her character.I also had a problem with the skip-Saturday-through-Thursday-BAM-IT'S-FRIDAY-skip-Saturday-through-Thursday-BAM-IT'S-FRIDAY narrative. The pacing of it just didn't work well for me. I wanted to see them come together more - by accident or not - in between meetings. I wanted those visceral punches of falling in love. Instead, that all sort of slid into place rather suddenly and I felt a bit cheated. I love a lot of sex in my romances, but the sex took up so much space here that there wasn't enough room for everything else.Maybe I would have felt slightly less like that if I had enjoyed the ****SPOILER!!**** public sex scene, because that was certainly a big part of their emotional journey. The authors took a big risk with that one, and it did NOT work for me. There's a biiiig difference between getting off on the risk of getting caught in public, and actually having sex on display in a sex club. ****END SPOILER****The downsides were definitely enough to knock off one, almost two stars for me. What a disappointment that this quite good read could easily have been a really great read.Still, it WAS quite good. And that Max... oof! *fans self*\n",

            "So a few days ago I gave my thoughts on author Allie Burke's Violet Midnight and so today I pass along my contemplations regarding the second book in The Enchanters Series Emerald Destiny. Yes, I enjoyed book one quite a bit, but I enjoyed it even more in conjunction with it's partner Emerald Destiny.Book two begins nearly 20 years after the events of book one. We, again, revisit the lives of Jane and Elias, but we are now joined with their children, twins, Abby and Daniel. These two, much like their parents, have very strong personalities and while they are very individual personalities, they also carry quite a bit of their parents in them, as well as, other family members. Daniel and Abby, also, have a VERY strong connection to each other, however, I felt that Daniel would be much more lost than Abby should they ever be separated for a long period of time.Speaking of connections, do you recall the strong connection that Elias and Jane have? Well, their daughter is dealing with a very similar issue. Evan Reed, son of her mother's ex, is her destiny. She knows it, he knows it and everyone around them knows it, so why are things so difficult? Oh you know...there has to be some form of conflict in every fantasy romance tale, right? It wouldn't be the same if things just fell into place all nice and neatly.Emerald Destiny has a smaller cast of characters than its predecessor, but we are still introduced to some new friend and enemies. Not only do we follow Abby and her brother Daniel, but we continue to learn more about Jane and Elias, which pleased me immensely. Old wounds are opened to reveal past secrets that lead to few answers and more questions. There, of course, is conflict that needs dealt with and lots of romance and lovey dovey stuff that will either make you go &#34;awwwwwwww&#34; or want to wretch.As I mentioned above, I felt that Violet Midnight was much better read along with Emerald Destiny and I am greatly looking forward to reading Amber Passion, which, I believe, is the final book in Then Enchanters Series. I will add that while MUCH better in book two, I still felt that certain scenes were rushed a bit, but not to the point of confusion as I felt in the first book. Overall, a definite fun read that must be read along with its partners to get the full effect.\n",

            "I actually debated with giving the book three stars, but he steps it up toward the end.I really loved the first full series. It was well written and paced nicely. I think the characters were well written and had easily distinguishable personalities. I liked how Richard was always in action and would deduce truths and when he would explain things to you and the secondary characters, you'd all realize he was right and the clues were there all along.Law of Nines was descent. However, with First Confessor, his work went down hill. He already had a tendency to preach his beliefs with his characters, but he went overboard trying to jam it down your throat without even advancing the story. So it was only about preaching and not good story writing. The worst part was that all his. Characters sounded the same. They didn't have their own voice. If you were to read their lines with no context, you wouldn't be able to tell one from the other.I don't feel like he covered much ground in the first book of this series. Consider that in the first book of the 1rst series, Richard traveled a lot, defeated Darken Rahl, and became Lord Rahl. Goodkind's writing can't survive inaction and that's my biggest gripe with this book. Over half of this book is of Richard sitting in a cave repeating speeches to a young woman before any action happens. I also think there is an issue with lack of voice here. Richard doesn't start acting in the way I've come to know till the end and I feel that some of the characters act realistically to how a person in there situation would. As an example. There is a young girl you'll read about who is much to forceful when talking to The Lord Rahl for a backwoods hick, even considering her small claim to authority. Just think of how you'd act on meeting someone with much less authority than Richard has, say a cop for instance. So that's how I feel about it, but it's still worth the read. You'll have to decide for yourself.\n",

            "If you're reading this review, I am assuming you've read the other two books in the series (there's a novella, too, with which I didn't bother). So this book is Jenna and Jimmy's story. Like all the other books, the POV trades off between them.At the beginning of this book, Jenna finds out she is pregnant from a one night stand. It wouldn't be a big deal except that the author decides the identity of the father should be a \"secret\", even from the reader. However, the idea that we don't know who the father is from page one, is laughable. It's almost offensive the way the author thinks the reader is so obtuse that we are supposed to be surprised when the father is \"revealed\" around page 70.What's more annoying is the vague dialogue used to mask the father's identity (inner dialogue too!! Like the characters are keeping the information from themselves!! So stupid!!) and waffling behavior by both Jenna and Jimmy (though ESPECIALLY Jimmy). Truthfully, I couldn't tell WHO Jimmy wanted to be with as he was talking about how he could easily fall back into a relationship with his ex, Chelsea, if she'd just say the word. That was on like page 20. Then all of a sudden, he's been thinking about Jenna for months? What?Then they take a huge step for no reason. But then, there might be a reason. But then there IS a reason, they just didn't know it. Maybe. This all happens in about ten pages. It doesn't really invest the reader with any kind of faith in their feelings for each other. Or even make the reader care, at all, if they get together.Then there's Jenna's ex husband, who is evidently Batman, as he can not be captured or stopped even in a closed venue or small town while being actively tailed by police. And I just want to put this out there--has the author EVER been to a rock concert? Because they routinely search for cameras, drugs and weapons. Just saying.The other books weren't works of genius but at least the characters were likable and their actions appeared to have some kind of logic to them. This book seemed to have been written by the author after staying up for five days straight, maybe with a hangover.Little continuity and even less possibility of engagement with any main character. The whole story was ridiculous from start to finish. If I hadn't wanted to write this review, I would have tossed the book at page 40. Seriously.I would have given one star except in this book, this rock band finally--FINALLY--has an actual rock concert! Only took 500 or so pages. I've never seen a story about a famous rock band with so little actual music happening. They play gigs in a bar in their tiny town and practice a lot but that's about it.And will we EVER know why the band is called 4225 West?? It's a really specific name, suggesting history or an address or place of significance. So why are we never told WTH it means?? Also, if it means nothing, it's a mouthful to say so not really great marketing technique on the band's part.Did I miss this explanation? Please let me know, if so.In any case, I was just kind of so-so about this series until this book. Now, I'm sorry I read any of them. Waste of money and time.Hopefully, my loss is your gain. Don't bother.One last note to all writers of rock stories out there: just because you wrote a book, and some of you have talent doing that, doesn't mean you can write a song. It is an entirely different animal. I am tired of reading the horrible, poorly metered lyrics these writers churn out, as if someone is going to read it and produce their song. Please, just stop. Describe the song and lyrics and how it makes the character feel. But if you really don't know how to write lyrics, then please refrain.Thanks.\n",

Turns out the way to get me really interested in your mystery is to give it a cute little sweater-like cover of a moose hanging.  And in a way, that really sums up the book.Friendship, Wisconsin is a friendly small town with a population of less than 700.  The most violent anyone gets is hunting deer, which is a matter of self preservation.  (Otherwise, they go into the road and the deer and the drivers die.)  Thus the town is rocked by the violent murder of Ruth Fried, particularly Kippy Bushman.  Ruth was Kippy's best friend and on her way to her house when she died.  Kippy feels guilty, but it's not until she talks to Ruth's brother that she realizes there might be more to the case than Ruth's hoodlum boyfriend getting violent.NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU is an interesting blend of tones.  The back compares it to Fargo, which is an obvious inspiration, but the humor isn't quite the same.  NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU has a ton more quirk for one thing.  But it's got the violence too.  The description of what happened to Ruth is absolutely awful.  There's a great deal of funny in NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU, but Ruth's death is never funny.  I'm going to mark that as a point in the book's favor.I enjoyed how the mystery developed.  There's a bunch of suspects for a town where everyone is too nice to be a suspect.  And I liked that the killer wasn't obvious.  It starts to become clear, but only at the same point that Kippy starts putting it together.  I also liked how Kippy's investigation is impeded by the police, who believe that the crime is solved and she's simply overly distraught.  (Kippy had a small mental breakdown following her mother's death years before.)If you're looking for a creepy, funny read with a hint of romance, look no farther than NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU.  I'd avoid it if you're allergic to all things quirky or twee, but otherwise it's quite fun.\n",

            "***Received from author for an honest review***(This is a short story/novella. This review is not based on story length but story content as length has very little to do with how much I enjoy a book.)Wow! I was blown away by this little story. Told in first person, we&#8217;re given front row seats to watch love blossom between Leah and Nate.Both are successful and seem to know what they want. They fall hard, fast, and unexpectedly for each other. Their love takes time to grow, more than a few days, more than a few weeks or months, and it was beautiful to watch.I loved how they seemed to give their all to each other, but that adoration faded when Nate started disappearing for longer periods of time, appearing in Leah&#8217;s life when it was convenient for him. I felt for Leah each time she put her life on hold, each time she wondered where he was, each time she slipped into despondency.This story offers two alternate endings. True, most romances end with an absolute HEA, but this one gives the reader a chance to choose the ending they prefer. I won&#8217;t give them away, you&#8217;ll have to read to find out, but both endings are thought provoking and completely probable.This is my first story by Ms. Ross, and I&#8217;m more than pleased with what she&#8217;s written.\n",

            "(3.5 stars) Sandy is on his way to meet his wife, Emily at the animal shelter she volunteers at in New York City. He is killed in an accident on the icy street. Sandy is offered a second chance at life if he goes back to right some of his wrongs towards Emily. He agrees but is upset to find out that he has come back as a stray at the shelter, Einstein. Emily has her own problems, such as finding out that her husband never left her the apartment in the Dakota as he had agreed to, and finding out from his journals that he was cheating on her. Emily is determined to find a way to stay in the apartment, despite her mother-in-law's insistence that she move out. Emily is also dealing with some major changes where she works a a small boutique publisher that has been acquired by a larger firm. Adding to her load is a visit from her sister, who is much more of a free spirit. She plans on writing about their mother, an early advocate for women's rights. Einstein must help nudge Emily towards resolving her past and moving towards a future, but sometimes his own motivations get in the way. What could have been a run-of-the-mill chick lit book actually has some interesting twists and turns, and it pleasantly surprised me. The book has some bittersweet moments, but comes to a satisfying, and more realistic conclusion than one would initially expect.\n",

Same with the self defense classes I found myself skipping ahead.

            "Vimanas have long been of interest, so I bought this book with high hopes.  The prospect of flying craft in the skies of ancient India is inherently interesting, and if true, raises a multitude of questions that demand answers.  Unfortunately, Childress's book adds little to the vimana lore or understanding.  There are, to be fair, some meaningful portions of the book, but the organization frequently keeps one on the fringes of the topic or veers into topics only loosely related .  What works against the credibility and is the most damaging is the author's strange choice to include the &#34;Vimanika Shastra&#34; document as a source.  He admits the work is highly questionable and was, most likely, &#34;channeled&#34; to the writer, and yet he devotes a whole chapter to it and ends up treating it as a valid source.  There are more authoritative books available, and I suggest buying one of them instead.\n",

Her mission is to find where Lucifer is hiding and find out what he is really up to. With Luce Iblis being her number one suspect, the smoldering hot CEO just adds plenty of trouble and temptation to her work.Oh what a fun story, I really enjoyed this one. Melody is really an angel, she is sweet, calm and calculating and overall takes her situation in stride. The books main focus was mostly on Mel as she stumbles through HELL trying to figure out which one of her co-workers is Lucifer. So with a little bit of mystery added to keep the book exciting as well as some office humor and satire made this book very enjoyable.The pace of the book varied, it started out fast and kind of slowed down a bit in the middle and picked up really in the end.

            "For me this book falls under the category of what could have been.  This is an interesting premise but its a little bit to &#34;artsy&#34; for me.  Its like one of those paintings where you know what all the little bits are but they look just a little odd and they don't quite fit together properly.  Lots of people are into that kind of thing so if you are this is a good book for you.  If you are looking just to be entertained then I would look for something else.\n",

Together, however, and there's a moment there, of connection with HaShem, that's supposed to change it all. Or at least Idleman asserts. There are plenty of reviewers that have tackled this very question. Additionally, I'm not reviewing the book, but rather the audiobook. When reviewing an audiobook, the purpose of the review is to ascertain if the audio is one worth listening to. So, on my end, I will assume that you will have decided on the content material, but now you are at a point where you need to decide on traditional reading format or auditory listening format.Heyborne's narration is clear and easy to understand. He reads at a medium pace and pauses slightly in-between sentences to allow readers to keep up. A softer voice, Heyborne's is not one I would mind listening to in the background or while on a drive. Overall, the audiobook edition is a quality edition to consider, breaking out of the mold of subpar quality and providing a voice that can match the author's intent. So, if you're on the fence on reading versus listening, this title is a good title to give audiobooks a go.Disclosure: I was contracted to write an honest review in exchange for a reviewer copy of the product.

And the story really does capture that &#34;Go where no man has gone before&#34; theme.I thought there was a nice pace to the book except for the huge data dump at the beginning with quite a few POV's provide so I was a little confused at first. But then the story really started to flow. This story is not a straight forward m/m romance there is more focus on the actual story than romance...which in my opinion wasn't bad.The story takes place well into the future where space travel is as common and just as regular as commercial flight. I don't want to say the main characters are Edward and Martin because everyone in this story had huge rolls and played key parts that without them the story would be lost. The Starfire Corp has developed a way to travel to the far reaches of the universe in a blink of an eye and there are those from the future that want to make that not happen. We do find out some reasons that some from the future don't want that to happen but there is another party at play who his even more driven to see that the mission fails.I loved the build up of everything the sabotage, the space mission, the murders, and the love story.

            "I didn&#8217;t need to read more than a couple of lines of the synopsis of The Martian before I knew I had to read this book.  I love stories set in space, and in this one, the main character is stranded alone on Mars after his NASA crewmates leave him behind, thinking he&#8217;d died in an accident.  He has no way to get off the planet and no way to communicate with NASA.  His only hope is to find a way to stay alive for several years until the next mission to Mars arrives.  This is an amazing set-up, isn&#8217;t it?  And The Martian had the good fortune to come out around the same time that the film, Gravity, with a similar theme of one person struggling to survive away from Earth, was racking up Oscars.The story drew me right in.  How could this astronaut, Mark Watney, find the means to get oxygen, water, and food on a barren planet?  How will he maintain the will to survive alone for years, when the chances for his rescue seem hopeless?  If he does manage to make it until the next mission arrives, how will he find them?  The Martian is written in the form of Watney&#8217;s diary, so we are right there with him as he gets into planning mode.  And he IMMEDIATELY gets into this mode, after a thorough assessment of his dire situation.  He calculates the amount of water and food he needs for the next few years, down to the liter and calorie.  He is trained as an engineer and botanist, so if all goes according to plan, he can maintain his equipment to provide oxygen and water, and he has the ability to grow potatoes.I initially found all of this fascinating.  It reminded me a lot of Not a Drop to Drink by Mindy McGinnis, in that the author made what could have been very dry facts seem interesting.  But after a time, it got to be too much.  I assume Andy Weir did an enormous amount of research for this book, because it reads like a step-by-step instruction manual for how to survive on Mars.  But that&#8217;s where the problems started to set in for me.  It began to become a never-ending series of: &#8220;This terrible thing X happened, but I fixed it by doing Y.&#8221;  I started to become unconcerned for Watney, because this guy had an answer for everything.Very early on &#8211; TINY SPOILER HERE &#8211; the book switches out of diary mode, and moves to NASA headquarters.  Through a major stroke of luck, an employee viewing satellite images discovers that Watney is alive, and unbeknownst to him, they begin to plan a dangerous rescue mission, with a high likelihood for failure.  These scenes provided a nice break from the increasing monotony of Watney&#8217;s experience on Mars.Through everything, Watney has an incredibly (and almost unbelievably) positive outlook.  He never seemed to despair, and he never seemed very angry.  He approached each day with a list of tasks that he methodically checked off.  At times, he seemed to find a good deal of humor in his situation.  Maybe these are qualities that astronauts need to possess, but it made it difficult to sympathize with his plight.Despite my few reservations, I would recommend this to any sci-fi fan.  There are good reasons why it has over 5k ratings on Goodreads with a nearly 4.40 average.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\n",

            "Twelfth in the Sister Frevisse medieval mystery series and revolving around Dame Frevisse, a Benedictine nun, and Joliffe, a player-writer turned spy for the bishop. Events take place in Bury St. Edmunds in England in 1447.If you're following the Sister Frevisse stories (and if you enjoyed her Joliffe, the Player series), you must read this one as events in this affect Frevisse and her relationship with Alice and Bishop Beaufort. Joliffe also plays in this.My TakeIt's not a typical Frevisse, for there's only the one bit of detecting&#8212;and Frevisse does have help from Joliffe and Pecock. Even Beaufort is stepping out of his usual role!This story does make me grateful for the Internet and a justice system with rules and regulations. Yes, those rules can get put aside---hello NSA, CIA, FBI---but it's more than Gloucester had back in 1447. Jesus.This is a sad tale with no happily-ever-after for anyone. It's mostly a tale of greed, but a greed for power, not money with actions that destroy families. Yes, there are politics involved, but no real discussion of strategy or true affairs of state. The best is simply mentions of Suffolk's influence on the king and how Suffolk's ego is affecting his relationship with Alice. I can't imagine future installments without Alice, so it will be interesting to see how Frazer resolves this.My favorite part is the play Wilde is putting on. It's a brilliant-sounding piece, and I do wish I could have been there. Joliffe is his usual witty self even as he's flying about, trying to do what he can for the bishop.There's a mention of Chaucer's translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, Boece, and it sounds like an interesting read. One to pick up, read a few pages, and think about it before continuing for another few. I very much appreciated Pecock's assessment of confession and penance. Such a very realistic viewpoint.The best of The Bastard's Tale is the why of all these people helping Arteys who's between a rock and a hard place; there are none of whom he would have expected to find aid. It's too bad there aren't more people willing to step up this way. Luckily, he does make good choices under the circumstances. Now if only Gloucester had been a bit more suspicious and Henry paying more attention...The StoryLured by the promise of his beloved wife's pardon, the out-of-favor Gloucester travels to Bury St. Edmunds where Parliament has been moved. And so gather the spies of lords and bishops.The CharactersDame Frevisse is a Benedictine nun at St. Frideswide with the Lady Alice of Suffolk her cousin. Suffolk has the king's ear and believes himself his equal. John de la Pole is the four-year-old Suffolk son and heir with his own part to play. Domina Elisabeth is still the prioress, and she sends Frevisse and Dame Perpetua as companion at the request of Henry Beaufort, Cardinal and Bishop of Winchester to spy for him in Bury. It's Sister Amicia who accompanies Frevisse back to London.Arteys is the bastard son of the Duke of Gloucester with no sense of his place or future. Humphrey, the Duke of Gloucester, is, until Henry has an heir, the heir to the throne of England with the Duke of York behind him. Gloucester's men include Sir Richard Middleton, Gryffydd ap Nicholas, Sir Roger Chamberlain, Yevan ap Jankyn, Jenkin ap Rhys, Master Richard Needham who is the member of Parliament for Dover and employed by Gloucester, Tom Herbert, Hal, Sir John Cheney, and Sir Robert Wer. Gloucester's wife, the Lady Eleanor, has been imprisoned for the past five years for witchcraft.Master Wilde is producing a play to present to the king as a gift from Abbot Babington. Wilde's wife, Joane, puts Frevisse to work hemming costumes. His son, Giles, has a part. John Lydgate is a Benedictine monk pushing to impose his taste upon the company.Master Noreys, a.k.a., Joliffe, is the Devil in so many ways.Master Grene is the warden of St. Saviour's where Gloucester will stay along with the king. Bishop Pecock of St. Asaph is a minor religious figure with a quick intellect. Runman is his servant, and Master Orle is his chaplain. Both are willing to do whatever the bishop needs. Brother Adam is in charge of the library and is forced to allow Dame Perpetua in.Isabella Tresham's husband, William, is Speaker for the Commons in Parliament.King Henry VI and his queen, Margaret, are in the toils of the Marquis of Suffolk. Sir John Stourton and Sir Thomas Stanley are lickspittles for Henry. The Marquis of Dorset, the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Salisbury, Viscount Beaumont, and Lord Sudeley are some of Suffolk's cronies. Edward Griggs is one of his yeomen.The CoverThe cover is a pale golden yellow split vertically with the left a long perspective of the river with its variously arched bridges and homes lining the banks. The right side is text-filled with the blue foil-backed title, the series name, the author's name, and informational data.The title is true enough, for it's The Bastard's Tale Frazer tells.\n",

            "The Word Exchange by Alena Graedon has a fascinating premise. In the near future, the printed word is all but dead. Nearly everyone in the U.S. has a device called a Meme. Even better than a Smartphone, Memes intuit what their owners need. Need a cab? Your Meme will hail one before you even realize it. Searching for a word? Your Meme will quickly find it for you on the Word Exchange, for only a few cents per word.Then people start showing signs of the Word Flu &#8211; using nonsense words instead of real ones, to the point where they can&#8217;t be understood. A powerful company has been buying up the rights to all the English words in the world, so Meme users have to pay more each time their Memes find a word for them. Copies of the last print edition of a great American dictionary are being burned; pretty soon the only place to look up words will be the Word Exchange. That and the Oxford English Dictionary, the lone holdout against greedy corporate interests.Although I have a Smartphone, I do worry about the influence of digital devices and social media on our lives. When one goes out for a meal with family or friends, one or more of the people present are constantly checking their devices. Studies show autocomplete functions when we text or write are changing the way we communicate, as many people are too lazy to find the word they mean and accept the generic word everyone is using instead.This book certainly taps into my own fears about what is happening in society. The author of a paper put out by the book&#8217;s word &#8220;underground resistance&#8221; writes, &#8220;Our facility for reflection has dimmed, taking with it our skill for deep and unfettered thinking.&#8221; (p. 85) I&#8217;ve had this thought myself, and ranted the following along with one of the characters:As a nation, we&#8217;ve been practicing mass production since before World War II. We believed wastefulness would morph, by magic, into wealth. That if we created enough disposable products, it would help fire consumerism. And it did, for a while. But here&#8217;s a dirty secret: resources are finite. Waste enough, and eventually it&#8217;s all used up. (p. 345)The Word Exchange is broken into 26 chapters, one for each of the letters in the English alphabet. Each chapter starts with a word and a definition. Although I loved the concept of this book, it&#8217;s not perfect. I had a very hard time following some plot points. There are two narrators, and one of them is suffering from the Word Flu. His chapters are filled with nonsense words, which got old very fast. But the book has a satisfying ending, and I recommend it to other readers interested in where technology is taking us. If you enjoyed Ready Player One, Amped, or A Working Theory of Love, you might enjoy The Word Exchange.I read an advance reader copy of The Word Exchange.\n",

            "Contemporary, Fallen Angels, Young AdultBoise, IdahoAirel is a 17-year-old that just wants to be normal.  Living in the small city of Boise she seems like just any other average teenager.  But soon those days are gone as she undergoes a change so drastic that she has to wonder if she didn&#8217;t just imagine it happening.  Airel soon has to learn to fight for her life as she is being pursued by an ancient enemy.  An enemy that will pursue her relentlessly in the deepest darkness.  Simply because of her lineage and who she is.  Now she will never have what she wanted most of all to be normal.This book starts the series off with a bang.  The suspense builds throughout the story and draws the reader in until they have to keep reading just to see what is actually happening and why it is happening.  As this story doesn&#8217;t give all the answers it will have readers wanting to read the next book just to see what happens next.  With every piece that is revealed it leads to more questions that make for a book that is a page turner.  The characters are very interesting and complex.  The story is almost two stories in one as it also gives the story of what has happened in the past while telling the story that is happening in the current time.  The two periods are woven together seamlessly so that the reader is never at a lost as to what is happening.  If the other books continue like the first this is going to be an explosive series.  It does leave a cliffhanger at the end that hopefully picks up in the next book.\n",

            "Like many people I have a love/hate relationship with social media. I like that I can keep up with some distant friends and family this way, but it's mostly just noise, at best meaningless, at worst it makes me dissatisfied and/or angry (I know that during the Charleston area's recent and continuing water crisis Facebook began as a great place to exchange information, but has now gotten to the point that my husband begs me not to look at it). I also resent all the time I waste reading about things I don't really care about and there is so much pressure to keep up. Anyway, a perfect topic for a writer like Eggers to take on and while I know a lot of people were underwhelmed by the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it - a solid 4.5 stars, even though it made me want to immediately go off the grid and pay only cash for items.Mae is over-educated and under-employed. Her college roommate, Annie manages to get her a job with her company, The Circle similar to Facebook only much bigger and encompassing more of everyday life (though the campus seems to have been modeled on Microsoft's) - \"the company had so much going on, so much humanity and good feeling, and was pioneering on all fronts, that she knew she was being improved just by being in the Circlers' proximity. It was like a well-curated organic grocery store: you knew, by shopping there, that you were healthier; you couldn't make a bad choice, because everything had been vetted already.\" (105)Mae becomes more and more enmeshed in life at (and in) the Circle, to the point in ruins most relationships she had prior to her new job. Her father is suffering from MS (one of the most successful parts of the books, I thought) and Mae's new job is, initially, a boon, but then becomes something darker for her family and old friends. In a conversation with her old boyfriend he notes, \"'listen, twenty years ago, it wasn't so cool to have a calculator watch, right? And spending all day inside playing with your calculator watch sent a clear message that you weren't doing so well socially. And judgments like 'like' and 'dislike' and 'smiles' and 'frowns' were limited to junior high. Someone would write a note and it would say, 'Do you like unicorns and stickers?' and you'd say, 'Yeah, I like unicorns and stickers! Smile!' That kind of thing. But now it's not just junior high kids who do it, it's everyone, and it seems to me sometimes I've entered some inverted zone, some mirror world where the dorkiest s*** in the world is completely dominant. The world has dorkified itself.'\". (133) Separate from the larger social issues Eggers does a good job showing how annoying it can all become (the issues with Alistair and the pushiness of total strangers rang very true). Though the last third of the book relied a bit heavily on 1984 and the aquarium section was a bit overwhelming, the end was both inevitable and incredibly interesting.Most readers will have no doubt about the big secret or be very surprised about the progression of the action, but even though much of what occurred was expected Eggers uses his gift for dialogue and creation of real characters (who of us hasn't been incredibly envious of friends, annoyed with parents or dated a person he/she didn't really care about?) to overcome the lack of suspense and did a great job showing how insidiously easy it can be to head down the slope. I couldn't wait to see how Eggers \"completed the circle\" of the novel.\n",

More frustrating yet, these transitions occur so frequently that they offered me little chance to know the characters, to sink down inside of them and feel their stories.I still don't know if this was intended by the author as a way of keeping the reader slightly off-center, if it was a device to mirror the action and tension of the storyline.Whatever the case, things changed around Page 60.

I got so angry that I literally yelled at my husband as I was telling him the cause of my misery!! The characters were so well thought out. I assumed this was going to be another &#34;erotic love story&#34; just like all the others but MAN, I've never been happier to be so wrong. I LOOOOVVVEEDD it! Read it, because it's definitely one I plan on revisiting over and over :) I'm totally more fond of my maiden name that's for sure &#34;Hudson!&#34;\n",

            "&#8220;Goshawk Squadron&#8221; is a novel by author Derek Robinson about a fictional squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (the predecessors of the Royal Air Force) in early 1918, during World War I.  But rather than this being a story about happy young men fighting a chivalrous war in the air against other similarly chivalrous young men, this novel shows what it was really like &#8230; a brutal, unsympathetic struggle where the pilots from both sides strove to ambush and kill their adversary before said adversary even knew he was there.  I don&#8217;t give spoilers in my reviews of fictional works, below are my impressions of this book.While the book touches all of the pilots in the squadron, it centers around the young, bitterly cynical commander, Major Woolley.  Robinson shows him as an eccentric, yet harshly effective commander, who is close to coming apart from the stress of his position.  The author gives interesting portraits of the replacement pilots coming into the squadron &#8230; young idealist men, who have no idea how the reality of the air war compares to the popularly idealized, sanitized version that they believed, and their gradual disillusionment delivered courtesy of Major Woolley.  Robinson writes in a darkly humorous way, that accurately describes the struggles both on the ground and in the air (although the air combat often becomes horrifying).A few years ago, I read &#8220;Winged Victory&#8221;, a semi-autobiographical novel by RFC pilot V.M. Yeates about the air war in France in 1918 flying Sopwith Camels.  Mr Yeates based his novel on his own experiences in the Royal Flying Corps in 1918, and the novel was widely acclaimed as being an authentic description of what it was actually like to live and fly in combat during World War I.  Although unlike Yeates, Robinsion obviously did not fly/fight aircraft in World War I, to me, &#8220;Goshawk Squadron&#8221; has the same ring of authenticity that I had when reading &#8220;Winged Victory&#8221;.  I highly recommend this book.  Five stars.\n",

            "Prepare for a little shock and awe - Raptor 6 was a thrill to read! From cover to cover Ronie Kendig&#8217;s &#8220;Rapid-Fire Fiction&#8221; will keep you turning pages. This was my first experience with the Christian Suspense genre and Ronie Kendig knocked my socks off. Kendig knows a thing or two about military operations and culture and she has clearly done her research for Raptor 6. She delivers a well constructed novel with nail-biting suspense, pulse-pounding action, and heart wrenching drama.Raptor 6 is a highly trained Army Special Forces team. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each member of the team over the course of the book. Each man had an assigned specialty and a unique personality that contributed to the cohesiveness of the unit. The banter between them was &#8220;clean&#8221; and the occasional use of expletives were done using made up phrases. I laughed out loud at the humorous ribbing that they gave one another. Their playful joking worked nicely to break up the tension in the more suspenseful moments.Captain Dean Watters is a born leader who inspires esprit de corps among his men. I grew to admire him as a man of strong character who is committed to his country and his team. He is a precision instrument of war - intelligent, focused and controlled. His desire to control circumstance and provide for the safety of others stems from a past that the author does an excellent job of revealing over time.Raptor 6 is more than military might and maneuvering, there is a romance that evolves between Zahrah Zarrick and Capt. Watters. Missionary Zahrah Zarrick won me over with her BOLD faith. She is a woman who is on fire for Christ and has completely surrendered herself to His service. Her resolve to trust God for her protection despite the turmoil around her baffles Capt. Watters. He lets himself believe that he is merely covering his six, looking out for retired General Peter Zarrick&#8217;s daughter, but there is something about Zahrah that he can&#8217;t escape.Keep in mind that this novel takes place in present day Afghanistan during a US military war on terrorism. These characters fight monumental spiritual battles as well as a physical dangers. The book has violence to include violence against women that may be difficult for some to read. Kendig does a tactful job of incorporating these egregious acts into a redeeming storyline.Ronie Kendig honors those who serve(d) in our military and has won a new fan. I strongly recommend Raptor 6 to men and women for it&#8217;s intricate plot and powerful message. I anxiously await the next book in The Quiet Professionals Series and give this Christian military suspense novel 5 stars! Buy it!\n",

            "BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND IAN EVERSEA is the ninth book in the Pennyroyal Green series.  Ian Eversea, the rogue who famously attempted to seduce the Duke of Falconbridge's fiancee in WHAT I DID FOR A DUKE and ended up going home naked, meets the Duke's ward Titania \"Tansy\" Danforth.  Tansy is an American heiress who has come to England to find a husband approved by the Duke.I really liked this book because it was about how people create masks to hide pain in their lives.  Both Tansy and Ian have created superficial flirty personalities in order to keep people at a distance.  While at first these two appear superficial, they are actually hiding depths that are discovered when they are together.At the same time, this book is very funny.  The reactions of men to Tansy are simply hysterical.  Men are just entranced with her.  The subtle competition over flowers with Olivia and the reactions of the other women in the book was also amusing.  At the same time, we see Tansy's caring nature in how she treats people.  My favorite part of the book is her list of qualities she desires in a husband which she adds to throughout the book.I also enjoyed spending time with the Duke and Genevieve again.  Because of the situation, Falconbridge is a significant part of this book and his actions in this book made me like him even more than before.While not necessary to read all the books in the series before this one (though I highly recommend starting at the beginning and reading all nine), I believe that a reader will enjoy this book better if they read at least WHAT I DID FOR A DUKE because of the continuation of the story from that book.Finally, I really hope the next book us about Olivia and Lyon because the events of this book leave me concerned.\n",

            "This is a good story, though too short to be considered a novel. I really appreciated the Christian theme. But the whole way through, the plural spelling of words was wrong.  An apostrophe indicates possession.  A plural does not require an apostrophe. Also a lack of understanding for there/their(s). There's would be short for there is.  If an author does not have a clear understanding of this, then the proofreader needs to be someone who does. This drives me crazy!!  And I suspect there are many others who feel the same. I also would have liked to know the the final word on Maddie. Maybe that is for the next book. I hope so!  Good job. Just needs a little tweaking.\n",

            "I've been waiting for an author to hear my silent prayer for a paranormal romance set in the roaring twenties. I've always been fond of the era with its iconic fashion and there are fewer times in history that seem as fun to drop a paranormal plot in than one already plagued by prohibition. Enter one of the very small handful of authors I pre-order without reading blurbs for, the sharp and sagacious Jenn Bennett.While the blurb for BITTER SPIRITS does a very wonderful job of presenting the basics of what you'll be reading I realized right away that as a reader of her urban fantasy series first I was mildly disappointed. I'm just so used to her voice without the romance as the central plot that it felt slow to take off. Once it did though, I struggled to put it down. A thorough researcher and quite impressively able to blend unexpected things together, Bennett made the odd mix of Chinese and Swedish characters and cultures truly immersive. I hated to be pulled away to scenes with just Aida and Winter&#8212;and mercy do they have chemistry!&#8212;simply because I was so invested in the world.When I was able to let go of the plethora of unique and enjoyable secondary characters long enough I really enjoyed the romance itself. Aida and Winter are a great couple, the sort you root for from the instant they meet. They're both a bit wounded and plagued by things they're not ready to tell one another which keeps them from falling in love too quickly. When they come together intimately it's scorching but not gratuitous, something I very much appreciated considering the era.By the time I finished BITTER SPIRITS I had run a gamut of emotions, become very fond of some secondary characters I hope get their own romantic tales later in the series, and decided I had to pre-order GRIM SHADOWS. It's not as thick on the paranormal elements as I'd love&#8212;what can I say? I'm addicted to monsters&#8212;but it's a ferocious romp with ghostly elements I think both paranormal romance readers and historical romance readers should give a taste.Notes: ARC received via author.\n",

Sydney is put in charge of protecting a royal moroi girl while the queen tries to throw out the law that is endangering the royal's life. She is also trying to reprove herself as trustworthy to her superiors.I am very pleased and happy that Richelle Mead decided to write a spin off series of The Vampire Academy. I was sad when the series ended. I even loved the way she tied it in so nicely to the previous series. It was absolutely amazing.The only thing I didn't really like all that much was the fact that the main character wasn't a moroi or dhamphir. I understand why she made Sydney the main character. It was her story after all. I just feel that Sydney being the main character made the story a little more stiff than if it was someone else. That's just my opinion though. Either way, the story was very enjoyable.I feel like I'm going to love this series as much as I did the Vampire Academy series. I fully recommend this book series to young adults and anybody who loves paranormal and supernatural books. I especially recommend it to all Vampire Academy lovers.\n",

It was set at a school where all the boys are giants and this guy, Joel, is a giant too, but he doesn't know why. But they are all sons of fallen angels which are called nephlim in the book and I guess that is from the Bible. This girl Rachel lives with her weird cousin and aunt, and she falls in love with Joel even though she was afraid of him at first. It helps that he saves her from the other nephlim who are evil. The nephlim are all in this project to be trained for war, and it is really pretty exciting because everybody is against Joel because he is better than they are.\n",

She tells things like it was beck when she when to school and how kids can be very cruel, which in turn makes someone feel even worse about themselves.

            "My first read with this author and I've already started on the second book.  I love historical romances and I looked forward to seeing if My Evans would be added to my faves.  Glad to say, she was added. At first, it was a little slow to get to the action, but once we got through the mutual attraction that each of the hero/heroine wasn't aware that the other felt it was smooth sailing. The physical description of the scars on Christian made me wince at times such was the author's ability to be precise without becoming morbid. We begin with our hero, Lord Markham, an Adonis come down to earth, returning from the battle at Waterloo, shunned by the same society who once worshipped him, he now has to pay for his pleasure. During one of his forays, he's accused of a heinous crime against a debutante. Forced to flee, he vows to return to England and clear his name. Lady Serena Castleton, daughter of a duke and a beauteous debutante, is literally &#34;sold&#34; in marriage to settle her father's numerous gambling debts. She finds out the hard way, that her marriage is no fairy-tale as he subjects her to heinous acts of depravity. Knowing she has to escape or die, she makes a break for freedom and answers an add for a governess to Lord Markham's ward..Lily. The author skillfully takes us on the journey back to England which is not without it's dangers. Lily cannot allow him to know who she really is especially since she has loved him from afar for as long as she can remember. The emotions that are evident between these two are so steamy as to make one blush. You can almost envision being an actual witness as they fight to protect each other, Christian from whomever wants to ruin him and Serena from a man bent on reclaiming his property.  With friends who stand by them, Ms. Evans takes you on an enjoyable ride and lets you peek into the world of the titled and wealthy.  A delightful read and I definitely recommend reading the follow up as it's a true &#34;Who done it&#34;  Only time and cunning will allow them to outwit their enemy.\n",

            "The Hunt For Pierre JNRDavid M. HenleyHarper Voyager, Jul 1 2014, $16.99ISBN: 9780732295608By the middle of the twenty-second century, a small segment of the twenty billion humans residing inside the domes evolved with extrasensory mental powers.  Derogatorily dubbed psionics by those who feared their superiority will allow dominance if unchecked; the World Union established the Services with a mission to control these dangerous mutants.  The Services aggressively capture, isolate and incarcerate psionics on remote islands in order to inhibit the impact of psi skills and prevent a revolt.In 2151 an experiment mated registered Psionics Pierre Sandro and Mary Kastonovich; which leads to giving birth to Pierre Jnr.  Three months later, Pierre Jnr escapes and vanishes.  In spite of a massive manhunt by the Services, he is not found and assumed dead as he is a baby even with special kinetic skills never remotely recorded before.However, the worst nightmare of those in power surfaces in 2159 when a sighting of eight year old Pierre Jnr is confirmed by the Weave; as the legend of a psi with the uncanny ability to control others&#8217; minds lives.  The Services assigns the best psi hunters of the Primacy military wing abetted by telepath Peter Lazarus who surrendered after three decades of freedom beneath the radar to prevent the most powerful psi ever, who he believed caused his sister to suicide, from killing the world.The Hunt for Pierre Jnr is a superb science fiction thriller that extrapolates present day issues like the environment and related moral and amoral responses into the next century.  Rapidly changing points of view makes it initially difficult to follow who&#8217;s who, but also brings a fabulous frantic desperate pace to this character-driven yet action-packed futuristic thriller.Harriet Klausner\n",

There were many characters in the intricately woven story, all juggling for attention at times making it easy to lose track of them by name.  I feel like I probably missed some of the details.  It's a good story, well worth a second read.  I believed the writing and even spent some time doing searches for anything that this might be based on.  I was almost surprised to find nothing in my searches.  Really well crafted story.Now for the less than great points.I felt like this could have been a bit better in it's pacing.  It's not always the case, but this could have probably been a bit longer.  I read a review that said the characters were clich&eacute;.  I don't think this is the case.  I think that they may have been glossed over a bit though, leading us to not fully appreciate the dimensionality of each member of the team.I haven't looked into the other books by this author or who publishes the works, etc.  but that said, I'd give this a five-star rating if there had been better editing.  Unlike many people, I do not blame authors for this at all.  When we craft a story, we must be able to hand it off to someone with less attachment, to edit and give feedback.  The spelling errors, sentence breaks, choppy areas that lose the reader a little can easily become blind spots to an author.  The writer creates a world and it's inhabitants.  They are by definition too close to look for what needs to be polished or clarified.  I would say that a revised version of this could easily be a five-star read, especially in such an affordable format.\n",

            "I bought this book in paperback ages ago and wanted a digital one to replace it. The recipes are just as great as I remember, but the digital format is a pain. Basically, the digital format is just a digital copy of the cookbook, with no helpful to each recipe. This makes finding and bookmarking the recipes horrible.Chef Paul's cookbook has lots of notations and suggestions for his dishes. In the original cookbook, he tells readers to go to page so-and-so for the Oyster Dressing, for example. Obviously, the page number technique doesn't work for Kindle but there is no digital equivalent to it, i.e. there is no link to the Oyster Dressing recipe. So you will have to type &#34;oyster dressing&#34; in search to find it. And if you're pairing the dressing with another dish, you will have to repeat this step many times. It's very frustrating and time-consuming.Final verdict: I'd recommend the recipes any day of the week but suggest you DON'T get the digital version until and if the publishers bother to add helpful links. The current format is not very friendly for practical application.\n",

He know's he is different when it comes to his sexuality.  He also knows the small town he lives in, may not accept who he is.Rowan moves to Chartreuse to start a new life after a breakup in his relationship.  He is now the town's Vet.  While walking his dog one morning, he meets Kasen.  A young man who is shy, and not very talkative.  Rowan also listens to the towns radio station.  There he listens to Cool Kasey, the DJ at the station.  Rowan really enjoys listening to Kasey. After offering to bring Kasey some dinner over, he finds Kasen at the station, as Kasey.  There, it all begins.  Rowan takes Kasen out of town for an early breakfast.  Just a small Waffle House, but a first for Kasen.  Rowan and Kasen's journey begins there.  Hidden thoughts and actions slowly begin between the two.This was a very touching story.  Very well written and put together nicely.  I don't usually read these kind of stories, but Tonya is my friend.  I'd read anything she has written.  Although this type of book was different for me, I learned so much about the lifestyle of two men who are attracted to each other, and the struggles they go through, just to be together.  If you're looking for hardcore sex scenes, you might want to chose a different book.  This is about tender exploring, finding someone you can be comfortable with, slowly receive feelings for, and experiencing what love feels like.  For the first time.

Clary Fray's mother has a mysterious secret, her father is long dead, and she and her platonic male best friend are enjoying an evening out at a club when she sees a group of teens that no one else can see, and watches them murder a guy whose body disintegrates into dust. In a matter of hours, Clary's mother is missing, she is chased by demons, none of her friends are what they seem, and she is taking shelter with the Shadowhunters, a group of people with mysterious powers pledged to protect humanity from demons, monsters, vampires, werewolves, and all manner of supposedly mythic creatures. She's caught up in a war that she doesn't understand, and the more she finds out the higher the stakes get.

            "Mr. Hicks does know how to spin a tale. Unfortunately, the tale is stale. Firstly, the book belong more to the fantasy genre rather than to SF proper. Thus it is absolved of making any sennse in terms of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, etc. One has to accept that alien females are perfectly sexually suitable to human males. Whoah! What a relief!! The author tries to make us sympathetic to the alien culture's focus on death and cruelty. I cannot find any warmth for this idea and I wonder how Reza, the hero of the book, does almost unquestioningly.  The hero spends 40 years or so on the alien planet while a war-to-the-death is going on between the two species. Unsurprisingly (?), despite all his loved ones having been wiped out by this war, not a word is said about it. The hero and his alien love intermix their blood, but none exhibit any side effects of this strange transfusion. And so on...Moreover, the writing is rife with corny expressions that should only appear in parodies, if at all. I, for one, will not read the sequels.\n",

I was curious to read your book that explored female fantasies, but they didn't interest me. I felt like I was watching one of those Twilight movies, looking around me in dismay. What was everyone getting so worked up about?So, it's not you, it's me. I am just not really responding to this at this time. I am not in the mood--or maybe I will never be in the mood. There are probably plenty of readers who would enjoy this, just not me. I remember I was in a used bookstore in Berkeley once and I overheard a coed say that she was &#34;just going to get a heavy breather and go for it.&#34; Looking around there were shelves and shelves of Harlequin Romances. Bodice rippers, I hear they are called. Fabio was on the cover of several of them. Perhaps that coed, and her many sorority sisters, would enjoy this book. Or maybe I was judging it too harshly and it was actually tantamount to Pride and Prejudice. A Jane Austen-like novel that is seemingly in the romance genre--concerned with matchmaking and gossip--but could be appreciated on a different level as an astute observation of the human condition.But I couldn't get into it. The heroine was trying to get you to sympathize with her over her lover's ex-girlfriend who had gotten pregnant and gotten back together with him. I couldn't pledge my allegiance to her. Later, there was an art auction. It was mostly about a secret society whose mission was to empower women and realize their fantasies. But I couldn't suspend my disbelief.

Dastien truly cares for Tessa and at times it seemed as though Tessa did not think about what her actions would do to Dastien (they are true bound mates after all).

            "I'm only on Chapter 7 but I'm utterly smitten with the heroine, a WWII pilot, and the illustrations. What a team of artists! The writing could be horrible but I'd keep turning pages just to see what amazing aviation and military inventions show up next. The thing is, the writing is as competent as the cover art. That's an understatement. I will review this novel for the August issue of Perihelion Science Fiction, along with information I'll pillage from the author's website. Charles A. Cornell has given waaay more thought to steam punk, diesel punk, and punk culture in general, than I have. Click on his name under the title of this book and visit his author page, twitter, facebook and web pages. What a world! People lament that the Golden Age of Science Fiction is dead. They are wrong. It has simply changed, as all progressive thinking and imagining should.Buy this book, if only for the illustrations, but also with the bonus of a great story with great characters. The Nazi villains are horrifying and I hate to read of their cruelty, but that part, sadly, is historically accurate. The Dragonfly, also sadly, is not historical, but imagined. The way great things appear in sci-fi first, then in real life, hey, who knows? Water-fueled aircraft may be in our future!Rare, oh, rare indeed, is the book that has me so enthralled and so eager to promote a new genre. Steampunk goes back only to 1987. Dieselpunk is even newer than that. I hadn't even heard of it until this year. I hope that means most other people haven't heard of it, either (I do hate being the last one to the party).I LOVE THIS NOVEL!More to come at the Perihelion ezine.\n",

Having an electrical fire start in her master bedroom leaves her shell shocked and in tears because those same photos were stored in a keepsake box in her bedroom and a major loss in the fire.Firefighter Gavin Morgan fights fires for a living and never has he had a reaction to a victim as intense as the one he felt the day Abby took comfort in his arms.Gavin has spent over two weeks since the fire where he met Abby thinking about her and it is driving him a little crazy because he has never been obsessive over a woman in the past, he comes up with a plan to get her out of his system and when his invitation is accepted by Abby he finds himself unable to carry out his anonymous seduction. Abby is humiliated and leaves in tears.The way the author manages to bring Abby and Gavin together after their disastrous second meeting is both honest and sweet, the way in which things work out between the pair however is sinfully sexy and a fitting ending to a very emotional story.As a whole this anthology epitomizes everything we all fantasize about and yearn for, someone who can be both a source of strength and comfort as well as someone who can make us burn out of control with a single touch or look. If you are in the mood for stories of strong men and women exploring their attraction to each other as well as bonding on an emotional level than these erotic tales are going to be just the ticket for warming you up!It is truly hard to say that any of the novellas are a favorite, each couples story brings something enjoyable as each author created their own unique contemporary romance with the perfect blend of sweet emotional connections along with flaming hot chemistry that burns brighter than any flames from one of the fires that these male heroes fight for a living![EArc from Netgalley in exchange for honest review]\n",

This just may be one of Koontz's best novels to date, and it could possibly be his masterpiece as well. A story of sadness, loss, suffering, love and hatred, it's also clearly a tale about beauty being more than skin deep. Koontz hits on some deeply profound subject matter in this mysterious and suspenseful story. Both Addison and Gwyneth were amazingly lovable characters. I enjoyed this book immensely.\n",

            "Twenty-two year old Rose Adams and her twenty-one-year-old sister, Ivy, experience the shock of their lives when their father dies unexpectedly leaving them orphaned, homeless, and penniless. It&#8217;s 1925, and up until then, the girls have been living in modest luxury in their attractive family home, Adams House, in the country town of Forest Grove, in upstate New York. Soon, the family&#8217;s solicitor explains to the sisters that not only was their father&#8217;s finances in ruin, but he&#8217;d been harboring an incredible secret: the girls had a older half-brother named Asher&#8230;and the family home has been willed exclusively to him. Evidently, their father had been trying to locate Asher for quite some time, but had failed. Now it was up to the two sisters to find him. The only clue they have is a photograph of Asher in front of a boarding house in New York City.Soon the sisters pack up what belongings they can carry and take the train to New York City. They arrive &#8220;like a pair of unexploded bombs.&#8221; It&#8217;s not hard for them to locate the boarding house in Greenwich Village that was in the background of Asher&#8217;s photograph. They need to learn more about their brother&#8217;s connection to this place, so they secure inexpensive attic accommodations and start questioning the boarders. Everyone says they&#8217;ve never seen him, but the sisters sense that they are all hiding something. There is an air of mystery over everything and everybody. Soon they&#8217;ve completely adapted to the crazy life of the boarding house. It is a fun place filled with rowdy, lively, bathtub-gin-loving modern women. There are also two nice-looking guys associated with the place who instantly move in on the sisters in a sweet romantic way.The book recreates what it might have been like for two young woman to be set free in The Big City during the Roaring Twenties&#8212;an era filled as much with jazz clubs, speakeasies, flappers, and bobs, as it was with enormous social, artistic, and cultural upheaval. The book does a very good job of putting the reader smack in middle of that exciting and tumultuous world&#8230;and that is exactly what I enjoyed most about this book.On the slightly negative side, the book dragged a bit in parts, especially in the beginning. However, eventually I got into the rhythm of the plot and it carried me along nicely right up to the gratifying ending. The characters, although somewhat stereotypical, were far better than I expected.Basically, it was one terrific story. It&#8217;s been a few days since I finished reading the book and the mental image of the two sisters and the story of what happened to them still tumbles around in my mind, giving me pleasure.For me, &#8220;Empire Girls&#8221; was a delightful, breezy, uplifting, family-oriented story with a touch of honest romance. It&#8217;s a book about relationships of all kinds: how important they are and how difficult it is to not be misunderstood by those who mean the most to you. And what&#8217;s not to like about that? I&#8217;d say, it&#8217;s a great choice to put on your light summer reading list.\n",

Getting those materials can be tricky and a lot depends on how strategically you placed your initial game pieces. You can gather an army, too. It is competitive, challenging and completely addicting.

            "This is one of those instances where I found that I quite enjoyed the prose, but didn't care much for the story.Finian was far and away the most endearing character, though I have to wonder if this has more to do with the brevity of the text--the book is only 160 pages long--than anything else. Corin/na was a take-charge kind of girl, and I give points for that, but I had a hard time really caring about her. More interesting to me was the world in which fae and selkie existed as a matter of course rather than curiosity.Billingsley's words flow in such a way that the book felt like a song. I felt like I was caught in a piece of music rather than a narrative, with its requisite ups and downs, fermatas and staccato phrases. She mentioned in the biography on the back flap that her Scottish father used to sing to her and her siblings each night, and I think that has something to do with it.As a writer, I wouldn't mind if some of that skill with prose wore off on me, but the story itself felt rushed.

I have not completed the book but from what I read so far, the author is absolutely correct.She talks about your biological age and your chronological age. There is also a test you can take to determine your results. Do not be surprised if your biological age is much older than your chronological age.There is a lot of information about the hidden sugars in our diet and she talks about the foods that help keep your blood sugar stabilized. She talks about Stevia and other artificial sweeteners. Also, expect to get a short lesson on gluten-free diets.The only thing I disliked about this book is that the chapters are labeled as Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and so on, instead of being labeled by the contents they contain.

Laurel is writing letters to dead celebrities as she tries to figure out her life. She is trying to cope with the fact that her mom ran away and her sister died. She's at a new school and makes some new friends. The writing is gorgeous and full of emotion. I love the way Laurel describes things, like the way she feels connected to the music of dead singers, or the performances of dead actors.About half way through, I started to lose interest. The beginning was so awesome, but then the same things kept getting rehashed over and over. The writing was still beautiful, and I really enjoyed Laurel's relationship with the dead people she keeps writing to. But the story had somehow lost it's spark for me. I didn't feel like I connected with the characters all that much. They were all pretty quirky, which isn't a bad thing, but it just wasn't MY thing.I'm not a teenager, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I can't be certain that I would have connected with the book even if I were a teenager. I'm chalking this one up to personal taste, because it really is a beautifully written book.Content: This one has a LOT of content. Underage drinking, sex between underage teens and older guys, drugs, smoking, passionate make out sessions with and without clothes, and quite a bit of language. Far too many F-words for my tastes.The Cover: I adore this cover! It is so gorgeous and it portrays the feel of this book really well. The cover was definitely a huge plus for me.\n",

I've read almost all of the books in the series so there is something there but the editing and the trite dialogue and the mushy way the cowboys talk sort of kills it. Incorrect names, changes in character descriptions, commas in the wrong place or not at all, and the cheesy dialogue were nearly too much, but I'm not a quitter and I saw something there too bad it never quite reached the good point. I can't recommend the series at the individual price of $4.99 per book. The glaring errors literally ripped me out of the story time and time again. I'd recommend finding an editor, perhaps a beta team that has medical, BDSM, and other qualified people in it to help the author get the facts straight, and lower the price to .99 cents. $5 is just way too much. I won't be buying anymore in the series...I just can't torture myself any further.\n",

            "The Basics:This is a tough one to describe without giving too much away, so bear with me. Eleanor is trying to slip through life unnoticed. Apart from her less earthly reasons, she and her terminally ill mother, and only confidante, are on public assistance, terrified of being separated by social services. As her mother's condition deteriorates and David, the only friend Eleanor has ever had, returns to town, she has to decide whether to open up and build a real life, or run away as she always has.The Downside:Um... let's see... well, David is the boyfriend every girl should dream of, and his patience with Eleanor is incredibly sweet, but just for the sake of giving him a bit more credit as someone in love rather than someone possibly addicted to abuse, she could be a bit less horrible to him at a few points when she&#8217;s less consciously trying to drive him away. And when Eleanor really starts to use what she is, maybe the chain of events could have been a little simpler. One plan gone awry fewer. Maybe.This section was hard to fill. It's a really, really good book.The Upside:Eleanor. The book and the character. It's pretty much all upside. The character of Eleanor is written with the depth and absence of condescension I always hope for in female leads but so rarely find, even from female authors. She loves deeply but is more than her love. She&#8217;s heroic yet vulnerable. The nature of what she is (which I shall not spoil) seamlessly influences the way she thinks and sees the world, making her distinctive and memorable.Eleanor isn't all that's vividly realized, either. For example, there's a part in which two characters in the same place at the same time are referred to by the same name for reasons I can't go into without spoilers. There are hardly any extra words used to specify which one is meant in each instance, and yet the whole sequence is far less confusing than this sentence describing it, because everything is so crisply described and the characters so identifiable by more than name or appearance.The magic is well integrated into the world, without taking over the whole story. The quite grounded drama surrounding the viciousness of the rumor mill, especially its treatment of girls, is cutting, insightful, and painfully relatable. The romance, rocky as Eleanor's struggle makes it, has a beautiful earnestness to it, and no matter how twisting and turning the final act, I was very sorry to see it end.\n",

The story is built around the relationships formed to help Callie and Kayden deal with the demons that stalk them and control their life's and how they grow through these issues. How the issues affect them and their friends and family members. I couldn't put this book down and immediately bought the sequel, Redemption of Callie and Kayden, to find out where it all ended.

            "This is not an easy book to categorize.  At best I would say that it's a fantasy alternate history.  Much of the story seems to follow a type of Stalinist style government with a vicious KGB service.  The major difference in this 'world' is that magic/supernatural still occurs.  More than this as a plot is hard to summarize.The major protagonist is a man named Lom (translates as 'scrap',who has an uncertain paternity).  He lives in the province that mirrors Siberia.  He is an 'investigator' for the secret service.  He has been called to the capital Mirgorod (which can be translated as universe or kingdom and was ordered built in a swampland (think St.Petersberg) by the Founder who could be Peter the Great) by an underminister.  He wants Lom to investigate the head of the secret service Lavrentia Chazia (Lavrenti Beria was Stalin's last head of the KGB).[Note: if you use a Russian-English translator on some of the names, you get a better idea as to what Higgins is trying to relate the characters to.]Lom, of course, gets involved in trying to counter a plot to bring down the Novozhd by his secret service.  The plots can be very convoluted and the supernatural becomes the major help/mover of what will happen.  The trouble is that there are so many agendas among the characters that it's hard to keep them straight.There is no question that this is the beginning of a series.  The ending of this book has set-up a whole series of unfinished business that will have to be resolved and we can guess who will have to do it.  A series well worth continuing to read.Zeb Kantrowitz\n",

            "There&#8217;s always a risk when it comes to falling in love with an author&#8217;s book.The big question is how on earth will their next story top it?Before I even opened Insipid, my expectations were really high. The gorgeous cover, the intriguing title, the captivating blurb and an interesting prologue that will make you crave for answers. Christine Brae&#8217;s previous books have been on top of my list for 2013 great reads, but could she do it again?&#34;Closing Doors. Is that what my life has been about? Is that why I am now doing the complete opposite? Opening them. Rebelling against life's best plaid plans? Living with the need to break free? But what is it that I'm running away from? What am I searching for?&#34;And for the 3rd time around, Christine Brae did not disappoint. Insipid has all the elements I like about her books. The romance, the challenging friendships and the integration of family life. The importance of these situations were balanced so nicely with delightful details and endings you wouldn&#8217;t have completely expected. The book is very organized and was very sure of its own identity even until the very end.Insipid is a great story of two people who need and seek isolation so that they may heal their old wounds but serendipitously end up falling love with each other. I really rooted for these two as I warmed up to both of them. It is beautiful!This story starts out with a great deal of sadness. Two young lovers looking forward to the rest of their lives crash and burn due to social status and differences. Jade, with a very sheltered life, and Chris struggling to have a successful career in basketball but never really had the chance to fulfill it. There are many flashbacks to the young couple&#8217;s fresh and vibrant life together which intermixed very well with the kind of life they had after the fall out. Much to my surprise and delight, there is a fascinating and intriguing mystery that kind of turns the story upside-down.Trying to move on with her bitter past, Jade, tries to live a normal life. Dedicating most of her time to her career, where she met the man who unexpectedly brought back the color in her life, Lucas.Despite of what he has become, Lucas did some stupid things in the past when the last girl almost broke him in more ways than one. But something happens that brings about an enormous change in his life. Lucas is determined to get closer to Jade, though the path to get there ain&#8217;t easy, he has the patience and strong will to stick it out. Maybe it&#8217;s the fact that he finds Jade so mysterious. Maybe because he sees her as someone so strong yet so breakable. Maybe because he feels that Jade needs him, and Lucas needs to be needed. Whatever it is, I loved watching their romance develop slowly.Insipid is a very quiet, gentle story that perfectly reflects not only Lucas and Jade&#8217;s characters but their slow struggle back toward life. There are many unforeseen obstacles with which they have to deal with, but in the end, truth and love prevail. It&#8217;s about hope and forgiveness. A loving story that truly allows two people who have been shattered for somewhat different reasons to heal, to blend, and to meld beautifully. Fantastic!&#34;The past. Sometimes, we get so hung up about it that it prevents us from looking ahead.Let the past go. Step forward no matter how much more comfortable you are with your past.Trust in your heart because it places its trust in you.&#34;If you like to read books with an emotional, meaningful story, with lots of character growth, twists and turns, and important life lessons, then give this one a go!Thanks to Ms. Brae for letting me be part of Lucas and Jade's journey. I am eagerly looking forward to read and experience your next book. 4 stars\n",

She falls in love for the first time but her mom wants her to go to New York City to become an actress as soon as she has enough money. Grace plans on going to New York just to make her mom happy.I liked Grace because she is good hearted and she tries to do the right thing. It was hard for me to believe that anyone could be as naive as Grace.This is a good story with a lot of unique characters and drama with many twists and turns.

            "This book is a companion to Johnson's Caldecott Honor book, \"Alphabet City\", although it is a bit darker and more somber. Johnson has created photo-realistic paintings of New York City scenes that feature the numerals one through twenty-one, with some, (like the Figure 8 on the cover), being obvious and some, (like a number 6 created from cogs, gears and shadows), resembling those figures used in eye/brain recognition tests.My first encounter with this book was when my five year old grandson pulled it from its shelf at the Children's Library. He plopped down on the floor and I plopped down right next to him and we poured over the paintings. Once we figured out the pictures were in order from one to twenty-one, and that there weren't going to be any words, we went to town playing number search. He got a lot of them on his own, and enjoyed getting the rest with some hints and suggestions. We both had a good time, and it was very rewarding to watch the little kid gears turning in his head as he searched the paintings.Of course, this is all about shapes and numbers, but as Kirkus noted, it is also about visual literacy. We talked about photo-realist painting and about composition. And we had fun.So, this is a game, a sophisticated introduction to composition, a bit of art instruction, and an all around happy book experience.\n",

            "This is definitely not the usual type of happy-fluffy Amish fiction that you might expect and I was very pleasantly surprised. The story is riveting, the characters are compelling and there is such strong, raw emotion woven through it, that I found myself dearly wishing for a sequel, because I wanted to know more about what would happen to Leah and her family and Jacob. I will admit that I read this entire tale in a single sitting, because I couldn't wait to find out more about Leah and I was surprised at some of the realities showed about Amish life and culture.For the story, the premise is quite simple, but the story itself is delightfully complicated. The Main character, Leah Rader, is struggling with some personal questions that seem to be conflicting with her Old Order Amish faith. Instead of chasing after superficial things, trinkets or Englisher ways, Leah's &#34;rebellion&#34; isn't really a rebellion at all--she's searching for truth, something to truly believe in, with her heart and soul. Reading along with Leah as she discovers the differences between &#34;religion&#34; and &#34;faith&#34; was very thought-provoking. Definitely a worthwhile read, ending on a hopeful note--even as Leah's bittersweet tale gently pokes your heart in all the right places.\n",

I just might need to call the fire department to pay me, I mean my house a visit, just to make sure my fire....I MEAN this house fire is put out. Do you think a Smith or three might show up at my door?!In all seriousness, I love books where there is a friends to lovers storyline. It is probably my favorite kind because of all the pent up sexual tension that has been smoldering. Jamie and Smith did NOT disappoint when it comes to the heat at all!Jamie is not interested in going there with Smith. Or so she keeps telling herself, nevermind all the feelings that rush through her whenever he is around. But despite those tingling sensations that are getting harder to ignore, she has seen how the whole friends to lovers thing plays out when things go south. And she values her friendship with Smith too much to put her true feelings for him on the line. Especially considering there is no way he feels the same way about her, right?Oh, how blind that poor girl is!Smith is feeling the exact same way Jamie is, right down to thinking he is the only one that has feelings for the other. And one night, when he finally sees that maybe it isn't so one-sided after all, he pounces. I am surprised their &#34;encounter&#34; that night didn't burn the building down, it was that HOT!But did crossing that line create a recipe for disaster? Is it possible that Jamie and Smith could work as more than friends despite all their differences? Or will they be another failed attempt of a friends to lovers romance? Well, you just have to read Burn For Me to see how things play out for these two! And believe me when I say, you don't want to miss a minute of their story.\n",

            "I, myself, will not help a stranger nor pick up a hitchhiker because of a story like this.  Would it be worth the risk of my life or fighting for my life?  How anyone can be so cruel is unfathomable to me.  And for him to be released from prison on these horrific crimes previously is unconscionable.  Is it really worth believing someone that is so sick in the head that he is reformed and let him go back into the communities and reoffend?  I don't think so.  The victims wife's determination to do what she felt she had to do to alert the communities and the law to sentence him to a long sentence and to keep him in prison is admirable.  She never gave up...thumbs up for her.\n",

            "Did someone say no holds barred? In Perception Xander Boone is a force. His massive physical size is only out done by the size of his heart and his capacity to love. His touch is exquisite, his desire intense. He is drawn to a woman&#8217;s inner strength, captivated by her intelligence and wit. Not just any woman. No, Xander has been drawn, for almost a decade, to Mercedes Bryant. And she to him. However, they both perceived themselves as Dominants. Lived their lives as such, never giving in to more than just a strong friendship. That is, until an opportunity arose that Xander couldn&#8217;t pass up. Putting his plan in motion and slowly laying all his cards on the table, he left Mercedes to reevaluate her perception of the past, the present and the possibility of a future. I couldn't wait to see what was going to play out. Both in and outside of the playroom. I was not disappointed in the least.I love Nicole&#8217;s characters. Xander and Mercedes, along with Shane, Clarissa, and Xander&#8217;s parents are fantastic. You get enough of their history to tie the binds, but the intense, fast paced writing allows the reader to stay in the moment. To experience the sensations and emotions. I very much appreciated the exploration of trust, pleasing your partner, honesty, connecting and love. The push and pull of their power struggle. The idea of altering your perception. The only thing that I find myself wondering as I&#8217;ve reached the end of the book is why sometimes the Dom~sub relationship is structured and sometimes they are just two people in love.  Did the story alter my perception or was that the whole point? That, in fact they moved away from the roles and just were. Undefined. Perception was a great read.The Club Destiny series continues to be surprising, arousing and ultimately offers something special for every type of erotic and romantic reader.\n",

I introduce concepts like testing, experiment, checking, persistence. I try to make it fun for a toddler but I could use more text. It is indeed an open-ended exercise and we'll definitely revisit this book as she ages to see what story she can come up with. It is rather short.For adults, there are a few lessons you can draw from this as other reviewers have mentioned, including the futility of perfectionism but I cannot figure out where the &#34;deeply expressive&#34; review is coming from.\n",

            "I think it is important to understand that when you're reading romance-y historical fiction, you aren't necessarily going to get a book that is historically accurate. So I try not to take accuracy into account when deciding how much I liked a historical fiction book. At first I was a little bit annoyed with the constant switching of points of view in this novel, but I got used to it as it went on. I definitely enjoyed Anne and Katherine's chapters more than Jane's, but I understand why the author included Jane's POV. Part of the reason I enjoyed this book was definitely that I find Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard to be the most interesting of Henry's wive, and Anne is my favorite of the 6 wives. I liked that the author tried to make Katherine sympathetic, because she is often presented as a bit of a slut, for lack of a better word, but she was only 21 when she died (although the book ages her down to be 16), so one can't really blame her for cheating on her ill, 50 year old husband with a man her own age.\n",

            "This is apparently Italy's answer to &#34;Fifty Shades of Whatever&#34; (which I have not read) - and it delivers a tame story but some genuinely sensual pages. As literature it's not worth much. But it does carry an erotic charge.Elena, a shy, restorer who is both a vegetarian and a teetotaler and who wears dowdy clothes without makeup (symbols of her repressed state) is working to bring new life to a faded fresco in a Venetian palazzo owned by a count. Incidentally, the Venetian backdrop to this tale does increase its allure and interest.Elena's profession is a not very subtle clue about the state of her own spirit. She is literally awakening the old colors with vibrant new ones. But, standing on a ladder, removed from earth, she experiences the world only with her eyes. She needs someone to force her other senses to awaken. As she brings the fresco back to life, who will do the same to Elena herself?Elena does have a male friend, Filippo, who is just as shy as she is - and perhaps both of them would like the relationship to become more than friendship if only they had the guts to act on their feelings. Eventually they pluck up courage, but then Filippo relocates to Rome before the love affair can develop.This leaves the field clear for celebrity chef Leonardo, who arrives to open a new restaurant in Venice. Soon Elena is literally eating from his hand. He offers sex pure and simple. He's in charge. Her choice is to accept what he is able to give without question. What he gives are a series of shuddering orgasms - but the man sleeps around, disappears for days or weeks on end and to say he has commitment issues is an understatement.We follow Elena through her awakening. The sex scenes have a kind of sweet old-fashioned tone to them. The descriptions are detailed but somehow not too clinical or specific. We don't get a complete play-by-play -- which is a good thing. So much romance writing delves into the micro-details and ends up being cold and impersonal. Here, for some reason, there remains a gauze of mystery even when the writing is very explicit. I also enjoyed the terminology -- &#34;he placed his sex in mine.&#34; no f word, no c word. It's kind of old-fashioned but sexier for that.The story meanders to its preordained conclusion in a rather unsatisfactory way. I understand this is part one of a trilogy and I don't have the need to read the other installments. Still, not a total washout.\n",

            "Four out of Five FangsI received a copy of this story for an honest review for Paranormal Romance and Authors that Rock!Sleeping Gods picks up months after renegade angel Cole abandons his great love Lexi in Lunangelique, the newly identified offspring of Moon Goddess Selene and warrior angel Edmund. Cole&#8217;s desertion coupled with the pressure of fulfilling the prophecy of awakening the sleeping ancient Gods trapped by Sun God Helios, crush Lexi and make her a ghost of her former self.&#8220;With every second that goes by, my anger and hurt for Cole leaving me turns into hate. I hate that he was a coward, I hate that it was so easy for him to leave me, I hate that he let my father drive him away, I hate that he has not once tried to contact me, I hate that he hurt me.&#8221;As Lexi turns to angel Patryck for comfort and support on her quest she doesn&#8217;t realize Cole is watching from the shadows. Cole left with the idea of protecting Lexi from the taint of his past but watching her slowly fall for Patryck drives him to the brink of insanity. When Cole reinserts himself in Lexi&#8217;s life and journey to awaken the God&#8217;s, she all but screams her displeasure.&#8220;Man, does it suck when someone you love everything about, hates something about you.&#8221;Sleeping Gods is an exciting and adventurous follow-up to Lunangelique. Author Kristin Campbell does a great job of balancing Lexi and crew&#8217;s epic quest to release the Gods with the mandatory angsty YA love triangle. Lexi&#8217;s heartbreak and Cole&#8217;s desperation give the two characters a little harder edge that match the sense of urgency in finding Lexi&#8217;s Goddess mother Selene and the other Gods locked away from the rest of the world. The introduction of new demi-gods and other ancient legends add new life to the story and getting both Lexi and Cole&#8217;s POV&#8217;s made the story richer.The one tiny complaint I have involves a member of the Lexi-Patryck-Cole love triangle. We as readers get to know fairly quickly in the story that one member of the triangle is a bad person with bad intentions. Lexi stays oblivious for the majority of the story. With her new Goddess/Angel powers she cannot tell she&#8217;s being lied to. Her super powerful Angel father and God/Angel brother cannot tell she&#8217;s being lied to. Only the other member of the triangle knows and he says nothing. I actually caught myself yelling at my Kindle &#8220;Just tell her already!&#8221;Overall Sleeping Gods is a great story full of energy, interesting lore, and well developed characters. I really enjoyed it and thought it was a great next step in the Lunangelique trilogy.\n",

            "T.H. Snyder did it again!!!  I have been waiting for this book since I read Cursed Love.  That is where I fell in love with Dault.Cursed Ecstasy picks up where Cursed Love left off.  Dault has to learn to deal with his past before he can move on to his future, and Etty has to decide if Dault is worth waiting for or if she should just move on.I loved this book.  It took me on one heck of  an emotional ride.  I fell in love with Dault even more. It was so great to get to know him and learn all his different layers.  Dault is a very complicated character.  While I have always been team Dault there were a few times that I wanted to slap him but as the story goes on and more details are released about the things he has been through the more the reader can understand what makes him the person he is.I was unsure about Etty during Cursed Love but I fell in love with her too!  Getting to know both of these characters on a deeper level was far more emotional then I thought it was going to be.  I was crying for the first time by chapter 3 and I cried a few other times as well.  I spent a lot of this heart broken for both characters, but when things got good they were really good and had me saying aww out loud. There were also times that I wanted to hit something and throw things(  I may or may not have thrown my e-reader) .  You also get to see some of Linc in this book and at times he made me angry but I still love him.T.H. Snyder knows how to write so that reader goes through the emotions with the characters and the reader can feel the emotions right along with the characters.  She is an amazing author and I can't wait to read more from her.\n",

            "Author Kate Deveaux has done it again! She easily drew me into the sexy erotic romance tale about lost love found and second chances that kept me turning the pages and wanting more!Academy Of Love follows the steamy love story of Cassianna Baxter and Lawrence Taylor. Cassianna returns to her alma mater, the all-girls boarding school Lewiston Academy, as the new Deputy Head Mistress. Twelve years ago as a student, Cassianna had a whirlwind affair with Lawrence, who was the equestrian riding instructor. But when Lawrence suddenly leaves the boarding school, he took Cassianna's heart, leaving her devastated. When Cassianna returns to the boarding school twelve years later, she literally bumps into Lawrence who is now an academy board member. Can Cassianna remain professional while the old flame smolders for her first love, a man she couldn't forget? Can lost love be found and given a second chance?Oh my goodness, this is one heck of a sexy story that has a little bit of everything that I look for in an erotic romance novel. It has naughtiness, passion, steamy sexual chemistry, angst, and a satisfying second chance at love interwoven within a well written description of the past and present dynamic of Cassianna and Lawrence's relationship. The storyline easy drew me into Cassianna and Lawrence's story, their relationship comes full circle as they discover that time and distance couldn't quell the desire and love that they still have for each. Their chemistry is palpable, their desire and love undeniable, and their passion is simply sigh worthy, even other people and communication issues can't keep them from finding their way back into each other's arms. Don't be misled by the racy book cover, this sassy erotic romance doesn't have a BDSM theme, but it sure does make you curious to look between the covers now doesn't it?!Academy Of Love is a well written and fast paced erotic romance story. It has richly detailed descriptions of the setting; realistic and flawed characters who are easy to relate to; witty dialogue and dramatic interactions; and a delightful romantic storyline about an undeniable love connection that was thoroughly enjoyable and left a satisfied smile on my face.\n",

            "There's so much room for fun when you've got a guy and a girl trying to play matchmaker for each other! You end up with scenes like this one, which occurs during the first date Troy sets up for Erin:&#8220;I should probably let you two have dinner alone,&#8221; Troy said. He started to stand.Without thinking, Erin pressed her hand to his thigh to keep him right where he was. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly. You drove all this way, you should stay and eat, too.&#8221;&#8220;I should?&#8221; Surprise and indecision were etched around his eyes.&#8220;Please,&#8221; she said, not lifting her hand. Bryce seemed nice enough, but there were no sparks. No flutters. She&#8217;d give him a chance, but would rather have Troy at her side when she did it.&#8220;Uh, well, they do serve a mean fettuccine Bolognese.&#8221;&#8220;I love fettuccine Bolognese.&#8221; She glanced up at the waitress. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have that, too, please. Bryce?&#8221;Bryce looked a little flummoxed. &#8220;The eggplant Parmesan.&#8221;Troy leaned over so his breath tickled the side of her neck. &#8220;He&#8217;s a vegetarian,&#8221; he whispered.Erin lifted her shoulder to her ear.&#8220;And while my leg is quite happy to hold your hand, I got the message.&#8221;She discreetly pulled her arm back and hoped her cheeks weren&#8217;t turning red. Troy made her forget herself. He scattered her brain cells in a most uninvited way.It was time to focus her attention on her date, Bryan. Bryce. She meant Bryce.LOL!It was nice finally seeing Erin have a HEA--she spent the first two books sitting on the sidelines, cheering on her two closest friends as they find love. Sela and Kagan are both back in book three, helping Erin to get a clue this time. (Because, really. Having a hot, single paramedic be your wingman? Please. Such a waste. Obviously you should be giving the guy a different job!)Troy is a fantastic hero. Not only does he have a drool-worthy uniform, but he's got an absolutely adorable relationship with his four-year-old niece. Who doesn't love to see that? He tries to find Erin a date, really he does--and not just because doing so will get him out of grocery duty for two months. He's genuinely a nice guy who wants to help people, all people, whenever he can.Too bad he's also pretty clueless. I mean seriously, dude--when you can't stop gazing into her eyes and getting distracted by thoughts of what you want to do to her? You're probably not going to be terribly successful finding her someone else. Or be terribly satisfied with the result if you actually do find her someone else.Luckily for Troy, he has a (slightly) older (twin) sister to help set him straight on that score. ;)I loved that Erin--the daredevil extraordinaire--is afraid of her own blood. It made for some cute scenes where she needed to be &#34;rescued&#34; (not that she's a damsel in need of rescuing, of course not!) by a hot paramedic. And his trusty four-year-old sidekick, in one instance. Did I mention, absolutely adorable?And speaking of adorable--the scene where Troy convinces Erin that they should be together is sigh-worthy. And it doesn't hurt that her older brother Luke (yep--he's back too!) has a behind-the-scenes hand in it as well.Robin Bielman's got plenty of room for more books in this series--yay! The youngest Watters sibling, Teague, suffers a romantic disaster in this one and so obviously needs her own happy ending. Troy's work buddy Oliver (the lucky guy who ends up not having to suffer undue ogling at the grocery store for two months) clearly could use a HEA as well. It would be nice to see Bree, Troy's widowed sister find love a second time, and.... See? Plenty of chances to revisit Cascade in the future. And I'll be there for them all, believe me.Want to come along? :)Rating: 4 stars/ BI received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review.\n",

He rages and just wants to return to the Apache.Now it is 10 years later and Jonathan doesn&#8217;t feel he lives any better in his world, but understands he cannot return to the old ways (the Apache are being placed on reservations).

            "This book gives you the impression that you are being dropped right in the middle of an ongoing story and that you need to have read previous stories to understand what they are referring to; however they are doing her origin story in flashbacks interspersed throughout the book. To be honest this is a better way of doing it, she is not a super hero and thus does not suddenly acquire her powers and go off and have wonderful adventures; she is a long time, battle hardened character who is very different in her finished state to how she is when she first starts out. This way we get to see how she survived the destruction of her village, how her family died and how she came to be enslaved with Annisa fighting for her life in the slave pits; while at the same time having a story with the completed article, the Red Sonja that we all know.For me the strongest and the weakest part of this book is its ending. Now I know that sentence is a complete contradiction, but allow me to explain. The book ties up everything and I mean absolutely any plot hook, any concept and any person who was seen in this book gets a resolution. This is wonderful in one way because what feels like backstory for the sake of giving us some context to the story is in fact vital for everything that happens. However it means that everything feels really contrived. Three or so bits of vital information that all come about at the same time on the same day in history all end up being combined and resolved all at the same time and it has left me in a difficult place to describe it.If this was a one shot book about a new character then it would work fine because you get that nice arc to the story, but for a character that is supposed to be part of an ongoing title it makes me question if every story is going to be the same; meet character, see the flashback to the last time they met, fight, resolution that ties everything up neatly. In fact, I have seen this done exactly in this way before and it was a TV series called Zena. You had 45 minutes to set up the plot, see where that came from in her chequered past and then watch it get resolved in the present. It works for a syndicated TV series where people have short attention spans and do not necessarily expect to catch the next episode, but in a title which is supposedly an ongoing series I am not convinced it works so well. I feel like I have read &#8216;Red Sonja;&#8217; I have seen her as a child, young woman and mature dealer of death, the story has come full circle and she walks off into the sunset; why do I want to pick up issue 7?Overall this is a good book and as a standalone trade then I could definitely recommend it to people who like the swords and (limited) sorcery.

Although I'm fond of Nick, and am interested in his take on things and his personal story, I really felt that it detracted from the Ty/Zane dynamic. I didn't get as much time with them as I'm used to and therefore wasn't able to go as deep with them. I kind of thought the sidewinder series was there to focus on Nick, while the cut & run was for our feisty pair.Don't misunderstand, there are still great Ty/Zane moments. I'm just used to it being all about them. I feel like I was spoiled with 7 books of pure Ty/Zane and now I have to share with Nick and don't wanna hahaBut whatever. I read these books to be entertained and I was entertained, so mission accomplished.So basically I liked it well enough.

            "After reading D. Nathan Hilliards&#8217; book Ghost, Monsters and Madmen I just had to read another anthology, as he seamlessly spawns them so naturally.Each tale was as mysteriously intriguing as the next with authentic characters and unnerving entities. Most of the endings left me pondering what if and wanting more.Even though each tale was incomparable with the next I found vengeance a common element threaded throughout the entities demeanours.Some tales described what outsiders to the events thought which sent chills down my spine and would make one think an occurrence of death whether classed as murder or natural maybe more than meets the eye.Exploring through the pages of horror I found scenes of every entity unforgettable and couldn&#8217;t help but fear them all. I thought the most feared to be Lamar Tarlington due to occult connections and sickening acts of his past. The scenes from Janies encounter in the &#8220;Legacy of Flies&#8221; as well as Russells&#8217; in &#8220;A Singularity of Purpose&#8221; provided an adrenaline rush.The book ended with a heart-warming tale, tears on my pillow and thoughts that made me reminisce about love ones that have passed.I highly recommend these tales of terror and my other favorite with even more tales and bite &#34;Ghost, Monsters and Madmen&#34;.\n",

            "Early in his book, when describing the video game of Pong, the author of Steve Jobs's biography puts the following aside: \"If you're under thirty, ask your parents.\" My son is only sixteen, and this is a book I would easily recommend to him or to people his age. They are at an age when they need to learn the power of dreams, the intricacies of life, the tragedy of sickness and death. They need role models they can look up to, while knowing at the same time that they will have to figure out by themselves what to do with their lives. I remember that my son was touched by Steve Jobs's death in more than a superficial way. So were all the young people who showed up at Apple stores worldwide to leave messages of bereavement and homage. Even with very little knowledge about his life, the CEO of Apple provided them with an alternate father figure. For them, he was this cool guy who spoke from a platform to disclose cool products, wearing his trademark black turtleneck and sporting a well-groomed beard.Steve Jobs actively contributed to his own legend. In countless interviews and magazine articles, he referred to his youth growing up in the counterculture of the seventies in California, where psychedelic drugs and progressive rock music merged with a DIY engineering culture. During lectures, he provoked university students with questions like: \"When did you lose your virginity\", or \"Did you try getting high on acid or LSD?\" More positively, he encouraged them to create their own business and to do things their own way. Creating one's startup in one's garage became a rite of passage for all aspiring entrepreneurs. After his return to the company that ousted him, Jobs became a symbol of reinvention and renaissance, an illustration of the saying that, in business as in life, it's not over until it's done.Perhaps more than stories about himself, which he couldn't always control, Jobs was careful to select self-portraits, and he refined his visual image with the same care he applied to the design of Apple's products. Job's first mentor had taught him how to \"impute\": to understand that people do judge a book by its cover, and therefore all the trappings and packaging of Apple signaled the value and importance of everything it was producing. Walter Isaacson's book cover is a fine example of minimalist style and attention for detail that characterized Steve Jobs's aesthetics. Its design was allegedly the only intervention that Jobs made in the book, leaving otherwise the biographer complete freedom to tell and interpret his story as he pleased. The book therefore gets the best of both worlds: it combines the widespread access to sources of an authorized biography and the independence of a well-researched journalistic account. Its publication two weeks after Jobs's disappearance couldn't have been more timely, and it met with enthusiastic critical applause.This book helped popularize the expression \"reality distortion field\" that many coworkers used to describe Jobs's ability to warp reality around his vision. The expression actually comes from Star Trek, like so many pop culture references of people belonging to the same generation. As expressed by this metaphor, some people have the power to bend space and time in their immediate vicinity. In their presence, reality is malleable, and the laws of gravity or attraction no longer apply. They can recreate their own world through sheer mental force, and impair upon people around them the vision that animates them. This spiritual power has become the staple of countless science-fiction movies, from The Matrix to Star Wars.Like the force in Star Wars, there was a dark side to the reality distortion field as well. \"To some people, calling it a reality distortion field was just a clever way to say that Jobs tended to lie,\" notes the biographer. This fits the portrait presented in the book: Jobs was often manipulative, and had a very particular relationship with the truth. The first person he tried to deceive was often himself. Like many self-absorbed persons, he selected within facts and figures the elements that fit his own plans, and discarded the other pieces of information as irrelevant. \"He can deceive himself,\" observed one of his close friends. \"It allows him to con people into believing his vision, because he has personally embraced and internalized it.\" \"It was a self-fulfilling distortion,\" commented another. \"You did the impossible, because you didn't realize it was impossible.\"At the root of reality distortion was Jobs's belief that the rules didn't apply to him. He was notorious for not putting a license plate on his car and parking it in the handicapped space, sometimes straddling two places. If he didn't want to deal with something--a legal annoyance, a business issue, his cancer diagnosis, a family tug--he could resolutely ignore it. \"Don't compromise\" was one of his favorite motto. He was alien to the idea of making trade-offs, and was intolerant of anyone who couldn't live up to his very exacting standards. He considered being rude to be part of his job description. \"If something sucks, I tell people in their face. It's my job to be honest,\" he told his biographer. As a collaborator remarked, \"we learned to interpret 'This is s***' to actually be a question that means, 'Tell me why this is the best way to do it'\". He often stated his goals in grandiose terms. \"Making a dent in the universe,\" and \"sending ripples to the galaxy,\" was how he described his purpose in life.A basic tenet of this book is that Jobs's personality was reflected in the products he created. Steve Jobs thought of himself as an artist, and his quest for perfection led him to control every aspect of a product's design, including its inner components and the paint color of the machines on which they were produced. One of his core principles was that hardware and software should be tightly integrated. \"Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana,\", he said, referring to Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak. His instinct for integrated systems and his drive for control put him squarely on one side of the most fundamental divide in the digital world: open versus closed. Very often, his insistence on producing close systems met with dire warnings. \"If Apple continues to rely on a proprietary architecture, the iPod will likely become a niche product,\" declared Harvard professor Clayton Christensen. \"Closed is the kiss of death,\" decreed another expert. But Apple was able to reinvent itself several times, betting the whole house at every juncture and revolutionizing whole industries in the process. Our world without Apple would have been a very different one.In the US context, this book would probably be rated 'R'. There are many instances of profanity and foul language, and the reader is spared no detail of Steve Jobs's wild years growing up in California. Apple's CEO remained true to his upbringing: he liked to state that \"taking LSD was one of the two or three most important things that he'd done in his life.\" His advice to young people was: \"Stay hungry. Stay foolish.\" He launched the advertising campaign \"Think different\" and \"Here is to the crazy ones\", which made for good marketing slogans but cannot be easily adopted as guidance for corporate strategy or parental education. But I am of the opinion that teenagers should be exposed early to the facts of life, and that they be allowed to make mistakes and learn from them. For these reasons, I am rating Steve Jobs's biography 'PG-13', and I am recommending it as birthday present to young people of the Internet generation.\n",

            "I found this book hard to put down. I loved that each chapter started with a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt. Sometimes it took awhile to connect the quote to the content of the chapter it headed. This was written in the 'first person' but was not self-centered. Some of the content could have been censored some, since it was rather personal. This is the first time I've read this author, but I would search out more of her writings. I enjoyed the honesty shown as she experiences her personal growth in confronting her fears for a year. I appreciated that she did not dwell on every fear she conquered, but a brief rundown of some of the smaller ones would have been enlightening. We all have large fears that may paralyze us at times, but the daily fears may be the ones that drive us to eat the wrong thing or say something not so nice. It also piqued my interest to search out more books on the Roosevelt's and their life together, and how Eleanor managed to handle the life she had chosen to stay in.

I hate comparing books to other books, but the best way I can think of describing &#34;In the Blood&#34; is if &#34;We Need to Talk About Kevin&#34; and &#34;Gone Girl&#34; had a book baby.Told from the point of view of college-aged compulsive liar, Lana Granger, the plot's twist and turns will keep you frantically turning pages as each story arc neatly intersects and culminates in a crazy conclusion. Who is Lana? What is her past? Where is her missing friend? Is she lying to herself or just the reader?I don't want to give away any secrets, but while some might finds parts of the novel far-fetched, I was was so consumed by the story that I didn't even notice at the time.Well-written, and a definite must for those that like psychological thrillers and blind-corner plot twists, I can't wait until my friends read this one so we can talk about it!\n",

If you have to mix a variety of ingredients in a bowl with a mixer and then &#34;dump&#34; them into a 9 x 13--not really a dump recipe unless one is using dump synonymously with pouring batter into a pan. The book is full of recipes like that. They may be great recipes, I don't know--but they are not all dump recipes by a long shot.2) The companion book for dump casseroles was really what I was interested in and it is a complete waste of paper.  It consists of about 30 pages, many printed on only one side.  The recipes are NOT dump recipes. They require browning and mixing and all manner of kitchen hubbub to get the casserole into the oven. These recipes are no easier than a standard recipe.The books, in my opinion, do not live up to the representation on TV, and I'm sorry I wasted my money.\n",

            "FM for Murder by Patricia Rockwell made me a fan. I had previously read Valentined, a book in another series that she has written. I loved this one even more. FM for Murder is the second in her acoustic mystery series.Patricia Barnes is a psychology professor who is enlisted for help with figuring out who murdered a disc jockey.  Her own daughter heard the murder happen on the radio. The disc jockey, AKA The Black Vulture, says a few words on the air before he is shot. Meanwhile we have flashbacks to a few days before with the story of Daniel Bridgewater. He is in charge of Bridgewater Carpets, a job that he does very well. His elderly father, the Charles, wants him to get married. But Daniel is determined to find his estranged brother. He is hoping that reconciliation can be achieved between the two before his father passes away.Patricia has the recording of the last minutes before the disc jockey was shot and listens it over and over again for clues about the voices on the tape.There are a lot of family secrets in story and information about acoustics in forensics. I really enjoyed learning about acoustics. Also there are false leads and big surprises. Towards the end, I kept saying &#8220;Oh!&#8221; out loud and my husband checked with me twice to see if was OK! It was that good. This is one mystery that I didn&#8217;t figure out along the way.I highly recommend this book to all cozy mystery readers.I received this book as a win from FirstReads but that in no way influenced my thoughts or feelings in this review.\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel because it was unpredictable, following the plot was effortless, and it challenged my mind and how I view the world. Kilroy illustrated this story so well; there were moments where I could imagine myself being a third wheel and trekking through this post apocalyptic disaster with Antigone and Shep. This tale is so real that I can't help but want to prepare for the world's end (I have to be honest and say that I want to be the one with an abundance of Ravioli and Spagheti-Os) With that being said, this story got my adrenaline going. I'd recommend this novel to anyone who wants to read a unique take on the Post Apocalypse.\n",

My wish came true when she came out with Secret Love.This is a little different for the author. It's set in the 1950's, but her characters are still fresh, engaging and likable! I loved the first chapter where we get a glimpse of Lizzie and Wayne as kids, and how she wanted to tell him how she felt. Fast forward ten years and now they work at the same school. Oh, and Wayne finally sees Lizzie as a beautiful adult he could fall in love with. But, she's his best friend's little sister....Still, Wayne can't hide his feelings, and Lizzie has never gotten over her crush, in fact, she still has her own feelings. I fell in love with these two falling in love! Simply beautiful!

            "Awesome story!I loved it all--from the emotions both characters brought about to the sweetness of the romance all the way through the funny moments and flirtatious banter.Lex Martin captured my attention instantly. She had me grinning from the moment Clementine and Gavin and anticipating when they would get together. Their connection was evident but developed slowly. Through some entertaining dialogue and funny moments, Lex Martin brought their connection to the surface and strengthened it the more time Gavin and Clementine spent together.I loved that their romance was not rushed. The pace worked well with the characters and the underlying conflict that was taking place. Their story felt believable and I could not put it down.It helped that the main characters were complex and intriguing. They had different personalities but complimented each other well by bringing the best out of the other. Gavin's flirtatious comments and laid back personality worked well with Clementine who had withdrawn into herself in the last years. Their interactions flowed easily through the page and only worked to deepened the connection that was already growing between them.Of course, Gavin and Clementine's chemistry worked well too. Although they each held back and started more as friends, their attraction was always under the surface of their interactions. I liked the fact that they had their doubts, but enjoyed it very much when they gave in to what the other was making them feel. I only wish I could have experienced some of the story through Gavin's eyes. He was a great character and I bet that his POV would have made this an even better story for me. However, the author did a great job of bringing forth his emotions and his character's personality to the page in a way that I felt that I could connect to him just as much as I did Clementine.The introduction of the secondary characters added to the story too. They each brought something different to the story whenever they interacted with either Gavin or Clementine. I'm especially curious about Clementine's brother Jax. He was so very different from his sister, but something tells me that he has more layers to him that what was let on in this story.With a bit of emotion, an abundance of chemistry and a great cast of characters, Dearest Clementine was a wonderful first book in a series. I can't wait to read more!All in all, a fantastic romantic read.\n",

It is about time that Stalins ghastly horrors and war crimes are comming to light. Stalins reign reivaled that of HItler, if one can imagine that. The Balkans are scared to talk about the war crimes because they fear retaliation. 20,000 people were killed under Stalins reign and it has silently been sweped under the carpet. I wish Hollywood would make a movie about this book or a dokumentary would be great too. In order to avoid a repeat of Staling / Hitlers attrocities, we need to expose these facts and constantly be reminded not to let something like this happen again.One thing I did not like about the book, was the giant gap between the last chapter and the epilogue. All the sudden Lina was not in Siberia anymore, she was married to Andrius and back in Lithuania? How did she get back to Lithuania? How did she and Andrius meet again?

I wanted to leave a comment on 2 very significant errors that I noticed right off the bat. The first is with the biscuit recipe on page 15. It calls for 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of heavy cream, and  cup of buttermilk. I make biscuits all the time, both with cream and buttermilk- I can say that the ratio of liquid to flour is incorrect. At the most you would use -1 cup of liquid for 2 cups of flour. This biscuit recipe is incorrect and will yield a liquid doughy mess. The second mistake I noticed was in the grits/egg casserole on page 23. They use 1 cup of quick grits, with 2 cups of water and 2 cups of milk. Again the liquids to grits ratio is inaccurate (4 &#62; 1). Those will be the soupiest grits ever. The recipes need some serious editing.

Kylie crushed on Trent for years, never to have her feelings returned except in the form of friendship. Then there&#8217;s Dray. Holy hottie on a stick! Kylie&#8217;s treated him like a brother and he&#8217;s been a total jerk to her most of that time.Then things change. And boy do they ever! What Kylie thought she knew about the men in her life is brought into question. There&#8217;s so much to consider and this is a heartfelt look at the turmoil that Kylie faces as what she thought she believed and felt turns on its head. My heart beat fast, I laughed, cried, and steamed up the place with the hotness factor. I truly appreciate that Nicole Reed pulled me through all of those emotions.Another factor that made this a win for me is Nicole Reed&#8217;s inclusion and treatment of Kylie&#8217;s relationships outside of Dray and Trent. Her best friend, Madison, her employees, and her mom and aunt. The depth of relationships, particularly with Madison and her aunt, Leigh, and the way Nicole adds humor and love and pain left me feeling as though I were also a part of their relationships.Overall, Nicole Reed delivered a don&#8217;t want to put it down read. There are a few twists that I didn&#8217;t expect and in the end, I felt it ended in the best way possible. I will definitely be reading other books by Nicole Reed as her dialogue, pacing, and story line captured me from the beginning and had me trying to find ways to read non-stop.\n",

First, it is very well written and edited, so there is no wincing as he discusses his adventures, reminisces on his past, and gives advice to, well, practically anybody.  I grew up in an age where it literally was a kid's dream to become an astronaut, so I can understand his childhood fascination (obsession?) to get into space, even at a time when there were no Canadian astronauts.  He worked very, very hard to make it into these ranks, and the book focuses in large part on his suggestions for others who have dreams.  Work hard, study hard, don't be a braggart, practice, practice, practice...  Really, is there anything in life that wouldn't be improved with this focus... swimming, cello, chemistry, or parenting?But the focus really is an insiders guide to being in space as an astronaut.  Hadfield spent time on both the Space Shuttle and on the International Space Station (ISS).

He recognizes a house in one of the pictures in the mansion and begins to wonder if it is the same place he used to fish with his grandfather.  He takes his mother with him the next weekend to see if she remembers anything; she does and the mystery begins.  While touring the mansion, his mother also finds out from the curator that they are in need of a part-time handyman.  Rich has plenty of time and experience, so he applies for and gets the job.Rich enjoys history and anything mechanical, so he soaks up the atmosphere in the mansion.  He also finds the curator, Patricia, very attractive.  Soon their relationship becomes more than employee and employer, but they are both afraid of making a commitment and voicing their growing feelings for one another.  Meanwhile, Rich is using his job to learn more about his grandfather, who is now deceased, and his alleged relationship some seventy years ago with the former owner of the mansion, the wealthy Rebecca Eastwick.The negatives to this story for me were the plot moved slowly in some parts and the unnecessary swearing.  Also, there were many typos in the book.  The positives were some great laugh out loud internal comments Rich made about himself or his mother.  I loved the relationship Rich had with his parents, the teasing between his parents and between himself and his parents.  The dialogue and fun relationship with Patricia was also really entertaining and absolutely hilarious to read at times.  I also thought it was very admirable how Rich handled his relationship with his kids by not bad mouthing his ex-wife in front of them or even when he was not in front of them.  He also treated her with much more respect than the nasty lady earned.  I would be interested in reading more books from this author.\n",

Clancy wasn't always great at clearing up what he was referring to, but luckily for me author, Weston Ochse, is better in that respect.Yes, he uses a lot of military jargon, but he either explains it or it's easier to decipher while reading in context.From the title alone, one can deduce that something wonky is going on, and Seal Team 666 is gonna clean it up for us. Seal Cadet Jack Walker is plucked from training and pushed through to become a member of Seal Team 666. And from there the action is pretty much non stop! Chimera, little demons that like to kick and scratch and nastier things that go bump in the night are aplenty.At times it was hard to keep the team members straight, on the other hand...well, read it and you'll get my drift.Early on in the book the team raids what can only be described as the worst kind of sweat shop, from there Ochse takes a few leaps and bounds in regards to moving the story forward, but I'll forgive him as the action was fun and wild!I'm looking forward to checking out Book two.\n",

            "I&#8217;m not one to read a lot of books about infidelity. While the topic is intriguing, I find myself to be too emotionally attached to the story, biting my nails as I read, feeling little sympathy for any of the characters and just wishing it was over.That is not what happened with The Other Half.Chloe, our mistress, is headstrong and smart, seeking to excel in her new career. Maggie, our wife, is talented conservative, trying hard to keep her marriage together and her husband interested.  That husband is James to his mistress, Jaime to his wife. That man is weak, confused and unable to make decisions.Rayner does a great job making both women relate-able. I don&#8217;t love Maggie though I felt bad for her being in this marriage she feels like she has to fix. She finds herself being the wife she never wanted to be, constantly compromising her feelings and needs for her husband and child. And nagging him about it.  I don&#8217;t love Chloe because even though she is a good person at heart, she knows sleeping with a married man is wrong. Yes, it&#8217;s his fault too, but Chloe knew what she was doing and didn&#8217;t stop herself. Even when she feels guilty through the book when Maggie is calling James on his cell phone. They&#8217;re both different, yet brilliant. They&#8217;re both trying to find their way, and their one biggest obstacle is James.Jaime is shown both through Maggie and Chloe&#8217;s eyes, allowing the reader to see this complete person who is trapped, charming and very very lost. He may not intend to hurt anyone, but no one comes out of this book unscathed. Of all the characters, I wanted to slap James the most. He&#8217;s mean, selfish and a liar.The story moves fast, reading more like chick lit. It was easy to sit down for hours and lose myself in their drama. Will they get caught? Do you want them to? Who am I rooting for?Overall, I enjoyed The Other Half way more than I thought I would. It moves quickly and I was glued to my seat, eager to find out how it ends.Rating 7 Would Recommend\n",

At times it seemed a bit tedious with the main character in yet another desperate situation so similar to previous ones, but that may be due to my old age.

I am disappointed that the remaining books are not available in audio form, but that won't keep me from reading them.The time between ending one book and purchasing the next decreases with each installment. While books 1-3 pretty much tell a complete story, book 4 does end on a major cliff-hanger. But at this point in the series, I feel the author has definitely earned it.

            "I've just finished this last book in the Cobweb Bride Trilogy and wow!  I very much enjoyed this story, it was very unique and so beautifully written.  The trilogy isn't without it's flaws, and in a less engaging story I would have stopped reading in book one.  The writing is so sublime but then an awkward or incorrect (by this I mean inappropriate in the context of the scene) word choice will pull me out of the story...but since I'm eager to know what happens next I keep reading.  That is a testimony to how very talented this author is, that in spite of the little flaws (which could be fixed with a good editor) I couldn't stop reading.  I'm very glad that the author stopped telling us every time a character had to &#34;answer nature's call&#34; (In Book one of the trilogy the reader was kept aware of how often the characters had to pee! lol)Gorgeous descriptions, intriguing characters and a compelling plot made this trilogy the most enjoyable one I've read in years, and the first one I've been invested enough in to finish in quite some time.  Now I'm off to see what else this author has written!\n",

            "[...]Book Review: Crimson Clouds by Claude Nougat: A Romance Fiction About Adulthood and Second AdulthoodCrimson Clouds by Claude Nougat is a fiction novel in Romance genre. Claude was born in Brussels and had her upbringing in Europe, Africa and America. She graduated in Economics from Columbia University. She has been versatile enough to put her hands on various professions &#8211; banking, publishing, journalism, marketing, teaching in a college and gradually landed in the Food and Agriculture Organizations, the United Nations in Rome as a project inspector. During her tenure of 20 years of successful career here she reached to a position of Director &#8211; Regional Representative &#8211; for Europe and Central Asia before retiring in 2003. She has many award winning books to her credit. She is one of the masters in Boomer literature aiming at Baby Boomers.Crimson Clouds by Claude Nougat is a romantic story but with a different level of gravity where one gets to understand the intricacies of matured passion and defies that could happen in the life after retirement which is also referred to as the second adulthood. There are five main characters in the book around whom the whole story of Crimson Clouds revolves. Robert is a 60 years old man, tall and quite attractive broadminded Frenchman who has spent almost his whole career in the United Nations climbing the career ladder to gradually reach to one of the highest levels. Robert is a man of great values and strong beliefs and differentiates well with a precision between Contemporary Art that he hates and the good art that he admires.Robert&#8217;s mother is a short, old lady but quite agile at her old age spending a good amount of time on her passion of painting even during her 90s. Robert&#8217;s father was a Consul of France in New York and she had no problem in balancing her life of being wife of a highly positioned diplomat and as a passionate painter. Natasha is the third main character of this story who has been with Robert since their childhood and both have maintained a good friendship. She is a journalist and an art photographer and is younger to Robert by around 5 years. She is the child of a French mother and a Russian father. Lastly we have two more important characters &#8211; Kay, younger to Robert by almost 20 years and is his wife. She, unlike Robert, loves Contemporary Art and has no interest in the values and beliefs maintained by Robert.Finally we have Nour who is 27 and Natasha&#8217;s daughter. Nour is intensely attractive but internally disturbed because of the circumstances she had to face during her youth when she lost her Iranian father in Paris and Natasha took over the complete responsibility of bringing her up. Nour has a drifting personality that gradually makes her an aimless entity in life.Overall, Crimson Clouds by Claude Nougat is quite intense, attention grabbing romance novel that will keep you hooked to it throughout because of strong characterization, excellent story and well woven plot.\n",

In the recent blizzard here it took me five hours to drive home in traffic, and I hardly noticed as the intriguing story unraveled. I do like how he puts the legal system in human perspective - it actually helped me in real life.He took a risk setting the story in the deep South - it wasn't his first, and one wondered about freshness, but the twists, turns, mini-mysteries, unlikely heroes, and life lessons made it a worthwhile listen.\n",

            "The Judge has correctly identified the result; Constitutional Freedom has been destroyed.  Unfortunately, he has misidentified the cause, as have most conservative writers on the Constitution.  The destruction began not long after implementation, as congress twisted the language and intent to accommodate their rapacious natures.  Thomas Jefferson, the principle author of the Constitution, wrote with &#8220;deepest affliction&#8221; to a friend in 1825, of his concerns about the restrictions on the federal government he had penned 38 years before and the &#8220;&#8230;rapid strides with which the federal branch of our government is advancing towards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the States, and the consolidation in itself of all powers, foreign and domestic&#8230; by constructions&#8230;that leave no limit to their power.  Under the power to regulate commerce, they assume indefinitely that also over agriculture and manufactures, and call it regulation to take the earnings of one of these branches of industry, and put them into the pockets of the other.&#8221;These &#8220;constructions&#8221; were remedied in 1861 by a new constitution which included the clause &#8220;nor shall any duties or taxes on importations from foreign nations be laid to promote or foster any branch of industry&#8221;.  It is not possible to give an advantage to one entity without simultaneously disadvantaging another, in this case northern congressmen passing tariffs supporting manufacture in their states which greatly disadvantaged southern states, which seceded from the union and wrote their own constitution, a vast improvement on the original in many of the adjustments.  But 750,000 deaths later rapaciousness resumed and the Confederate Constitution was delegated to an historic curiosity when the south lost the war.  The stench from the growing Oligarchy and graft gave credibility to the changes Judge Napolitano chronicles in this book, Theodore and Woodrow, and FDR as well.  But they were arguably a response to the chaos resulting from congressional graft at the time, and not the cause of the destruction.  Now liberals and conservatives face off, blaming each other, while graft and destruction of Liberty continue unabated at the source.\n",

            "Let me Start off by saying this is the first Christian Fiction Novel that I have read with that being said the content of this book was greatly developed the twist and turns in this story was unbelievable,and it was written so well that I felt like I was apart of the story as it was being told. It was not predictable by the least bit but yet it was informative, eye opening, jaw dropping and thought provoking. The Sunday Morning Wife speaks to the hearts of abuse woman everywhere as well as it speaks to the hearts of the christians that may have questioned God and turn their backs on him for one reason or another. Thru this story you can find your way back to God. Yolanda faith in this story displays that even when your world is in discord, and you have nothing left to hold onto or nowhere to turn fight the fight that a true christian can fight, and watch God win the battle for you as he did for Yolanda.Character development was excellent because the characters were totally developed from beginning to end. Each character made you emphasize with them about their past,present and future. The characters pulled you into their world of totally you felt their anger, rage, depression, and their pain they felt throughout the story. They made you realize why they were who they were, and why they did the things they did.In Conclusion, this story taught faith, repentance, and trust in the Lord in all that you do and lean not on your own understanding.Once again the Author did a great job grammatically as well as structurally.\n",

            "Dieting has so many negative connotations to it. The author is a nutritionist who has broken down the steps that are normally taken to lose weight and dissected what makes them work or fail. A little planning can change your diet into a lifestyle that will help you lose weight without the ups and downs, disappointments, and confusion.There are several of her recommendations that won't work for me. Several of them (1 carb a day, eat lots of fish protein) are unrealistic for me and my lifestyle. But overall the book seems to be filled with practical advice. Most of the things mentioned were common sense thoughts that I'd already heard (high protein breakfast, no snacks after supper, exercising every week). But for someone just starting out on the diet path, this book will be a great little resource.I received this book free of charge from Goodreads in exchange for my honest review.\n",

At first I was in 'ok, what happens to X?' mode and resented the detail. As I read more, I started forcing myself to relax and enjoy the detail. You realize each character is giving you a different perception of central idea. The author really wants you to get the feel of each situation. Characters are revealed like peeling an onion - you get deeper each time they reappear. The fundamental idea behind it? I don't buy it but hey, it's fiction - and he remains true to the 'world' he has created - the crucial thing. It kept me up too many nights.I've been reading Sci-Fi since the late 50's so Asimov, Heinlein, etc. Also newer by Stross (Accelerando the best) , Neil Stephenson (Cryptonomicon!

            "I am yet adjusting to reading books through my kindle reader. It has been a trying transition from hard copy to digital. But this book MUDDIED By Meg Mathisen managed to make me completely forget about my issues with ebooks!. The format was delicious in the way it moved back and forth between past and present. It allowed you to root for the main character Greta at all points in her life. I do not know if there is any real connection with the author and this story, but it reads like a personal experience which translates to a very real feel. The character is so tragic and yet heroic at times that you end up feeling compelled to just give her a hug and a warm place to be. The tragedy experienced by all the characters induces genuine feelings of rage, terror and pity. MUDDIED kept my attention with unexpected surprises and throat clenching revelations. The scary overtones manage to leave you concerned about the characters and what will eventually become of them. I can also relate to the main characters night terrors. It felt so real that I slept with the lights on last night when I finished the book!. I am sure that there are those who will be able to relate to the drunken binges as a way to escape the pain of bad memories and a hard life. Overall I really liked this book and I appreciated the genuine effort that went into the writing. I hope that Meg Mathisen decides to do a follow up story so that we can see what happens to these people. I will be thinking of Greta for a long time to come as she is the type of character that leaves you feeling some kind of way and encourages you to pay closer attention to the choices you make in your own life. Great read! More Please!!!\n",

As mysteries, the books are lacking a bit, but as humor they are superb.  There are five recurring, on screen, characters and two who are present but never witnessed.  The other characters are, unfortunately, disposable.  We should be able to see some of them again.

            "Being a sucker for Mickey Haller (and any Michael Connelly book) I hate to say a bad word, but in Gods of Guilt I had trouble (a) keeping track of who the characters were and (b) caring about the case. Haller once knew and had feelings for the murdered prostitute ... but did I read about that in an earlier book? I don't remember, so hard to get emotionally involved. The guy he's defending, on trial for her murder, is a pimp and not a character you can like very much. The connections between the drug king in prison and the DEA agent and the investigator Lankford with a longtime dislike for Haller. Did I read about that in an earlier book? I don't remember so hard to recall why he dislikes Haller, hard to figure out (even by the ending) what Lankford had to do with the DEA guy, the drug king, and the prostitute ... Haller's personal life and sort-of estrangement from his young daughter isn't explored enough to get the reader emotionally involved -- once again, the whole story of his ex wives and his daughter played out in earlier books ... and while I DO remember all that, the personal story is not woven very deeply into this book. So once again, it's hard to get emotionally involved in the story -- let alone keep the characters and plot points straight. THE BRIGHT SPOT is that the last few chapters really come to life with edge-of-your-chair events unfolding during the (at last) trial of the pimp, with a rousing and satisfying ending (and possible reconciliation of Haller and his daughter ... which may play out in future books. Which I will certainly read. In spite of this one sagging in the middle, I'm hooked on Mickey Haller and all Connelly books.)\n",

Some prefer a good plotline mixed in with their smut, while others take a more &#8220;get to the nitty gritty&#8221; approach.  They want their erotica hot, fast, and satisfying.  Mya Fanci delivers the latter packaged in a nice assortment of erotic tales in the short story series Spicy Collection Volume I.  The book includes:The Best Friend's BoyBench PressRanch HelpTexas TakeoffThe Roommate's CallTruth Be ToldNurse CareRoslyn ManorThe Slow ThawRoyal RendezvousThe stories are what one might consider as erotica for women.  Each tale is a fantasy come true for many readers out there, and the author sets the tone appropriately with the first story, My Best Friend&#8217;s Boy.  In it, a MILF named Stacey is surprised when her best friend&#8217;s son returns home on holiday from college looking like a completely different person.  He&#8217;s blossomed into a handsome young man who isn&#8217;t afraid to go after what he wants.  She soon discovers that the erotica she enjoys reading isn&#8217;t the only place where lovers make each other&#8217;s dreams come true.  Each subsequent addition is similarly written with a little something something for everyone.  Admittedly, my favorite is Truth Be Told, where patient and doctor confidentiality is of the utmost importance with two attractive neighbors.Spicy Collection I is tastefully done with sexy scenes that get straight to the point.  With 10 stories back to back, you&#8217;ll find yourself excited, maybe too excited, to finish.  This would be very awesome for couples who want to spice up their lovemaking, or a confident woman getting in the mood alone.

I was really sad for this story to end. I feel like this ending is just the beginning to something far greater and more satisfying. You will value every page of this book.

            "Ar first I thought this book was mainly aimed at novice lockpickers. The author made some recommendations that seemed like they were aimed at helping the user spend money wisely. Then came the section on tubular lock picking and it went off the rails. The first style of lockpicks were very basic and quite affordable as well as being effective. Then the author went on to endorse a lock-picking tool that cost well over $400 and that required different \"tips\" at $50 each. This tool was HUGE and awkward to use unless you were in a lock shop or at home on a workbench. Totally impractical for field use. The name of the tool is the \"Peterson Pro-1 Tubular Lockpick\" by Peterson Manufacturing. They have a website and you can view the lockpick and it's accessories there.What the author totally ignored was the Deluxe ACE Tubular Lockpick. This item is sold in many stores and you can see it being used in the excellent video \"Lock Picking for the New Millenium\". It cost much less at around $270 and no additional parts are necessary. It's easier to use and is much more compact. Perfect for both the novice and the pro.There were other recommendations that I have found to be not that good, especially when it came to individual picks. The book is easy enough to read, but I would be careful about taking it's recommendations. Makes me wonder if the author is getting some kind of kickback from certain lockpick tool makers.\n",

            "This book is book 2 in a series, which I realized when I bought it, and you don&#8217;t need to read the first book to understand what&#8217;s going on in this book, they give enough background on the main characters. It works as a standalone.The writing level is decent, about a 3/4 out of 5 stars for writing. The author probably won&#8217;t be winning any awards, but at least it didn&#8217;t annoy me and was well edited. The storyline is a 3 out of 5, it was really slow in the beginning. And just to point out, the title is &#8216;Never Courted, Suddenly Wed&#8217;, but the heroine, Sophie, is courted, by 2 men, for most the book, which in the storyline is approx 2 weeks. Than the Hero, Christopher, compromises her, and another week later they are wed. When they finally do wed it&#8217;s at 70% through the book. So I wouldn&#8217;t say she was never courted, and quite the opposite of &#8220;suddenly&#8221; wed!The first 70% of the book drags on, there are some funny scenes, and I did laugh, but it got a little tedious. You really learn a lot of their past as childhood nemesis&#8217;s and ALL the stuff they did to each other. Though Christopher was 14 and Sophie was 7, why would he have cared back then? Anyway, once they are wed everything seems lovely, everyone is happy, they are in the country enjoying their wedding trip, than Christopher&#8217;s dad arrives, he stirs up some trouble and Sophie runs away. This is at just over 82% through the book. Christopher follows her and they make up very quickly because the book than ends.Christopher turns out to be dyslexic and it would have been nice to spend some time on how Sophie would help him deal with it, it could have been a great bridge for them to cross together. Also it was once mentioned that while he couldn&#8217;t read because the words didn&#8217;t always make sense (dyslexia), it says he&#8217;s always been great with numbers, his dad being in debt, it would have been great if we could have seen how brilliant he really was when it came to accounting, instead of being told in one short blob in the book. Also throughout the whole book Sophie&#8217;s brother is made to look like, and they even refer to him, as a &#8220;pompous ass&#8221;, than at the very end he says how he cares for her, and how he even rejected several marriage offers because he wanted her to be happy in marriage, what!?! So out of character for him!!! And Sophie&#8217;s mother was no better, she was always pushing her needs above her daughters than when Sophie gets married she acts so uncharacteristically, I wasn&#8217;t buying it on either accounts.Overall a decent read. Not the best, not the worst I&#8217;ve read, falls right into the mediocre level, hence 3 stars. I&#8217;d only recommend if it&#8217;s on sale and you want a light, easy read, it does offer some humorous scenes in the beginning but brace yourself for a quick wrap up as the ending.\n",

            "Christmas in Apple Ridge by Cindy Woodsmall, is a three story contemporary compilation centering around a small town in Pennsylvania. These are full books compiled here, not novellas, so you get a lot of reading for your money with this volume, it's a good bargain.The first installment is The Sound of Sleigh Bells, and although very solidly written it is my least favorite of the three. In this story we meet Beth Hertzler, co-owner of the local dry goods store, and Jonah, a wood carver from Ohio who is suffering the physical effects of a sleighing accident. Beth has been mourning the death of her fiance for what her aunt, Lizzy, believes is an unhealthy amount of time. When Beth meets Jonah during a business trip and is drawn to his talent and soft spoken manner, Lizzie conspires to bring the two very reserved and wounded souls together in friendship via letter writing. The complication is that both Beth and Jonah are under some misunderstanding about who they are actually writing to. Will Lizzy's plan backfire or finally bring love to two people who had given up on marriage? This story dragged a bit in the middle, but the reveal toward the end of Beth's back story was quite unexpected and interesting. It is well worth reading, and these two characters appear again in both of the next two stories in the most charming of ways.  The Christmas Singing features Mattie and Gideon. Mattie was heartbroken when Gideon broke up with her on Christmas Eve and has worked hard to hide her heart from anyone who tries to take it. Gideon has lived with a secret illness and brokenness since his break-up with Mattie. Can they get along enough to figure out they still love each other? The message in this book was to trust God with everything. You can't protect everyone, only God can do that. The Dawn of ChristmasThis is the story of Levi and Sadie. Sadie was engaged once and found that she could not trust her fiance after finding him with her cousin. She left and went on a three year mission trip to Peru. When she returns home, she is determined to remain single.She is literally thrown together Levi and when Sadie saves him after an accident. Levi is also determined to stay single after friends of his have gone have experienced heartache. One of those friends is the old fiance of Sadie. The two join forced to stay singe and soon find out that they may have found what they weren't looking for.Over all - they were all wonderful Christmas stories. I really love to read novellas since they are fast and easy reads. I would recommend them to anyone looking for inspiring holiday stories.  NOTE : I received a copy of Christmas in Apple Ridge at no cost, in exchange for an honest review, by Waterbrook Press.\n",

            "REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT DEAR AUTHOR WHERE I RECEIVED THE BOOK AS FREE REVIEWING COPYDear KJ Charles,I reviewed the first book in this series here. Now that some time has passed I can say that it was probably my favorite m/m book last year. I am usually wary of reading the sequel to a beloved book, because I worry whether the sequel will live up to the high bar that the first book raised. I am glad that for me this sequel definitely did. Now I can worry about the third book.This book should not be read as a stand &#8211; alone. If you do read this first, I do not think you will be terribly confused, because the adventure/mystery plot is a new one, but the book continues to build up the relationship between the main characters, Lucien Crane and Stephen Day, and most importantly it once again develops their characters in the midst of all that danger, magic and mayhem.One of the main reasons why I often scoff at the possibility of a sequel (or series developed) to a book I loved is because so many authors seem to be so very fond of creating artificial conflicts between the couple, just to break them up for the sake of another book and then putting them back together at the end. But there is absolutely nothing artificial in the tension between Stephen and Lucien in this book, because it arises out of who they are, and the unresolved issues in their relationship are believable because their relationship is only several months old. And of course there is a nice external danger to both of them, which made perfect sense in the context of the mystery/adventure plot.More importantly, the unresolved issues between the men do not make them act like idiots. For example, in the very beginning of the book somebody has decided to blackmail Lucien over his relationship with Stephen and made his demands known to Lucien. It is part of Lucien&#8217;s nature to try and protect Stephen (even though he is aware of Stephen&#8217;s abilities to protect himself). I was very pleased to see that it did not occur to Lucien to hide the blackmailer&#8217;s visit from Stephen, and he let his lover know as soon as possible about the blackmail attempt. I do not know why I was even worried for a second that this would be the source of a quarrel between the guys and a reason for manufactured conflict/breakup/angst (take your pick). I really must start trusting this writer not to lead me towards silly plot turns.I was also pleased to see both men becoming more and more aware of each other flaws, but still loving each other more, not less. It was refreshing to see Lucien realize (with a little push from Merrick) how much Stephen&#8217;s pride means to him and try to curb his own &#8220;wanting to rescue&#8221; tendencies. At the same time Stephen would at least attempt to ask for help, hopefully because he understood that asking for help sometimes did not make him weak. And their declaration of love was so appropriate and so suited to both of them. When we see Stephen&#8217;s desire to protect Lucien at all costs despite what it seemed to have cost him in terms of his cherished job, it made me wonder whether these men are really that different inside. I decided not.I must praise the adventure/mystery/magic storyline &#8211; I loved it just as much as I loved it in the first book. It made the characters shine, but more importantly it made me hold my breath wondering what would happen next and I read without hesitation the creepiness that I am usually more likely to pass in many other books. I did not want to miss a word; I had to know what was going on. I was also pleased to become more acquainted with Stephen&#8217;s partner Esther and other practitioners from his team. I am really hoping that I will see more of them in the next book of these series. I liked Esther a lot, but I think she could have used more fleshing out. Merrick, Crane&#8217;s manservant and friend was just as awesome in this book, and I while I was a bit scared to see the extent of his ruthlessness, I am glad the writer did not shy away from it. I liked that we learned more about what Merrick and Crane did in China as well.The writing was just as wonderful as in the first book. Here is an example to give you a taste, so that you can decide whether it works for you. Lucien was asked to do a little translating work for Stephen and his team ;).&#8220;Crane knew from Stephen that Mrs. Gold was the senior member of the team, and that she resented the common assumption that she was subordinate to the men. He addressed his next words to her. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t think this is a vulgar curiosity, but if you want me to translate when someone arrives, it would help to know what I need to discuss. What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;The practitioners glanced at each other, quick fleeting looks. Esther Gold said,&#8220;Rats.&#8221;&#8220;Rats?&#8221;&#8220;Rats.&#8221;&#8220;We got a rat problem.&#8221; Saint wore a malicious grin.&#8220;I suppose you know you can hire a man and a dog in any pub in this city,&#8221; Crane offered blandly.&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t help,&#8221; Stephen said. &#8220;Joss, show him.&#8221;Janossi put a toe under a fold of the sackcloth bundle and flipped it over. Crane walked over and looked at what lay within.It was undeniably a rat. It long yellow teeth were bared in death. Its eyes were blood-filled and bulging, which Crane attributed to Stephen, since he had seen a man dead that way at his hands. Its matted, dirty brown pelt was stiff with filth and dust, its claws were grey and scaly, its naked tail pinkish. It was a rat like any other, except in one respect.It was about four feet long, not counting the tail, and would have stood perhaps a foot high at the shoulder.&#8221;I cannot wait for the next installment in this series. Oh and what a refreshing idea it is, to choose not to end every book in the series with the cliffhanger.Recommended.Grade A-\n",

            "No doubt Kresley Cole knows how to write a hot story. In The Warlord Wants Forever, she does it again. The story of Nicolai Wroth and Myst the Coveted is as spicy and entertaining as you can expect. But there is something missing in this book. I really liked it&#8230; but not as much as the ones I read before.Nicolai falls for Myst after meeting her in a dungeon in a castle belonging to the Horde he has just captured. Myst feels immediately attracted by the austere warrior, but after blooding him she abandons him to suffer for five years the anguish of wanting release and being unable to get it. When Nicolai finally finds her in New Orleans, he unexpectedly encounters the means to make her suffer the same way she did to him, but he decides to use his new weapon to make her fall in love with him.Well, maybe I am a bit rancorous, but I just don&#8217;t get that the revenge you have been demanding for five years can be so easily forgotten. I mean, Nicolai is a bit softie when it comes to his Bride. As for Myst&#8230; She behaved like a real bitch and then she also forgets easily&#8230; I like the book, but I think there should be more tension, more working in the relationship between these two. I had the impression that they both changed their minds way too fast. Maybe it is because it is the first book of the saga and she doesn&#8217;t elaborate as much as the following ones. No doubt I should have read it first, but as always I started the series with the second (the one I had at hand) and got engrossed in the books and forgot there was a previous one. Anyway, the book is great, and I really enjoyed discovering the story of the eldest of the really juicy Wroth brothers.\n",

            "As CEO of the world's most successful energy company, Lowell Bracken is at the top of his game and beginning to plan for his children to succeed him. But when a small upstart solar power company enters the scene, it triggers a series of political dominoes that will completely destabilize the power structures of the entire planet, and Lowell will be lucky to escape with his children - and his skin - intact.This one is hard to pigeon hole. Part eco-drama. Part fantasy. Part political thriller. It's set on an alien planet, but with a tech level similar to our own. There is some kind of pseudo-magic, and dragons, but both are kept fairly low key in this first installment.Despite these promising elements, this one didn't quite grab me. Lowell in particular seemed rather inconsistent. He's touted as a ruthless and ultra-savvy CEO who built his company up from ashes, against heroic obstacles. But when the chips were down, I never saw any of that heroic ferocity and competence in evidence. If anything, he comes across as a has-been who is now easily duped and slightly bewildered. It's one of those cases where the author describes the kind of character we all love to admire, but doesn't actually write him in a way that's consistent with the hype. And while some of the other characters do live up to their billing, they are so uni-dimensional that I wasn't able to bond emotionally with any of them.Overall, I felt like this book took me to the brink of a really enjoyable ride, but left me standing there. It didn't quite have the horsepower to tip me over the edge and deliver.\n",

In previous books of the Blood Curse series, we have read of how the Jaegar vampires (Dark) treated innocents and even their own people, it is beyond cruel, horrendous, or atrocious, but this is how Saber was raised and has lived for 800 years; now he has been told he was stolen and raised in the wrong house, that he is really a Jadon vampire (Light), how can he just change overnight to become someone else and Vanya (the destiny of Saber and our heroine) what she had been through, how she had been coping with becoming the person she thought she should be for herself and her people, but inside her heart wishing she could become the person she wanted to be.  The continual angst that Saber mind was always going through was a deep-down heartfelt thing to read along with the continual battle of Vanya struggling with who she wanted to become.  Ms Dawn wrote Saber's character and story so you can actually feel his torment and anger coming off the pages and could see the slow change taking place in Vanya; it is one of the best stories I have read in a long time.

About halfway through it started taking longer and longer for me to pick the book up again.  I eventually skimmed the rest of the book and put it down.I saw another review talk about how there's too much domesticity in this book, and I think that was part of the problem.  It's always nice to have the hero's every day life make an appearance in a book, but in this book there was too much family life, day job and visiting with friends. It slowed the pace down to a crawl and got a bit boring.Despite having trouble being hooked by this book, there was enough promise that I'll give book two a shot.\n",

            "I liked this a lot. It's a slow burner. It not so much bursts from the traps as it does strides confidently from them, looks around, does things in its own time, and then when you're comfortable, it goes for the jugular.It's the tale of an unnamed narrator. He's a university professor, uprooted from an unfulfilling life in England with a wife he doesn't love, and planted back into the soil in Korea, or Seoul to be more specific (Seoul soil?), where he finds himself living an unfulfilling life with a wife he doesn't love, and a 'best friend' he barely knows. He teaches English Literature in a university where a falsified pass rate is infinitely more important than the education of Korea's young.Enter Hana Kim, an 18 year old student with both beauty and intelligence on her side. She approaches our narrator to discuss works of literature, and the pair begin regular meetings to discuss books, and life in general. From here on in he becomes besotted by the girl, initially by what she represents, which is a release from the mundanity of his existence. The longer the book goes on, the more unhinged and dangerous his obsession becomes.So yeah. It's a slow burner, but it's compulsive reading from the off. I had the narrator pegged as a selfish and blinkered fool early on, the way he constantly refers to his Mrs as 'The wife' with a disdain best reserved for enemies, the descriptions of his childhood spattered with venom whenever his over bearing mother is mentioned. He screams out to be shaken, and told to grow up, but I don't think he'd listen. Steve Justice has created a superb character in his narrator, and he fleshes the man out in such an expert manner that it's hard to believe that this is a debut.The bizarre mental justifications for his equally bizarre actions have you clenching your teeth in annoyance, wishing you could 'have a word' with him, to try to shake some sense into his stupid head. Seriously, it's getting me mad just thinking about it. And that, my friends, is one of the many strengths to Steve Justice's writing, he draws a reaction from you. He doesn't just tell you a story, he pulls you in to watch from close up, but without the luxury of being able to do anything about it.So I'd recommend this book any day of the week. The author has created an unhinged anti-hero to rival the best of them. Truly, if this is how strong Steve Justice's debut novel is, I'm almost scared of what it will look like when he takes it to the next level. Powerful stuff.\n",

This book is riddled with grammatical and syntax errors. The writing is sophomoric at best. I felt like the story had potential but the writer really missed the mark on this one. Scenes jumped so quickly I had to keep looking back to see if I missed something.

I do not discount that something is going on, I know something is going on and it is not going away. That much I agree with. I do not believe we will see an alien spaceship land on the White House lawn and they will proclaim themselves our creators. Though, the theology and mystery behind these tales is interesting just by itself.The mere fact the Catholic Church is involved in this speaks volume of the issue. So, thus, it must be taken seriously, even if one does not agree or believe in it, it still must be taken seriously and everyone who has an interest in this issue, whether remotely or jump in the middle of it, must take this book into account.I do recommend this book, and Tom Horn and Cris Putnam offers an interesting take on a unique subject.\n",

With or without false papers, her life might only stretch as far as the next hour. What did he really want with her?\" Kate Breslin writes in her debut novel, \"For Such A Time.\"At four hundred and thirty-two pages, this paperback targets those interested in historical fiction and romance, especially during World War Two when millions of Jews were sent to prison camps. With no profanity, the topic of war, abuse, and death would make the story not appropriate for nave readers. The ending includes the author's notes, a glossary of German and Jewish terms, eleven discussion questions, and acknowledgements.In this page-turner, twenty-three year old Hadassah Benjamin finds herself in front of a firing squad while she has been imprisoned at Dachau, Germany. After one shot is fired, she is saved by SS Kommadant Colonel Aric von Schmidt, who takes her to the transit camp in Czechoslovakia.Unable to comprehend fully why she has been brought into his private residence at the camp, her name is changed to Stella Muller and she becomes his secretary.  Her beautiful but beaten body takes time to heal as she prays God would convey His message to her.Befriending several other Jews within the ghetto, the Mischling does not want to be one of the German zoinehs the SS officers think she is. Forced to type up lists of adults and children to be sent on trains to Auschwitz, she struggles to keep her identity secret.As the Colonel commands the camp with its ruthless soldiers, he finds Stella to be unwavering, determined, and selfless when it comes to protecting those of the Jewish race. More than once, both must reign in their desires as they stay patriotic and loyal to their countries.With each chapter in sync with the Biblical story of Esther, Breslin saturates the tale with the need to call on God for guidance, knowing He is in control of all things. Her detailed, compassionate words give readers hope that overcomes the heartbreak during such a tumultuous time.Focusing on finding freedom both physically and spiritually, this book leaves readers remembering the horrific tragedy that happened so long ago and how man can learn from mistakes and find salvation.Thanks to Bethany House for furnishing this book in exchange for a review based on the reader's honest opinion.\n",

            "Three letters sum up my reaction to the book Younger Next Year: Live Strong, Fit, and Sexy - Until You're 80 and Beyond by Chris Crowley and Henry Lodge. You can choose either WOW or OMG. For me, this is a life-changer. (At least I hope it is.) In reality, a lot of the information, the what, was not new to me. What was new was the why. And in this book, the why is pretty compelling. I found myself actually wanting to get to the gym more. That is pretty amazing. My diet is already pretty good, but I found myself wanting to make it better. The comparison between aging and decay rattled around in my head almost constantly. I was convinced pretty early in the book that decay is a very bad thing and generally is preventable.Younger Next Year is a book by men about men. That was not a turn off to me but it might be for some women. I was able to readily see that the science is the same, no matter the gender. Don't despair though, there is a version written specifically for women and I browsed it too. No matter which one you choose, the important thing is to read the book and follow Harry's Rules. I am absolutely confident that they can change lives.\n",

            "Reviewed by Angie Just Read...for TheRomanceReviews.comShe has a rule against dating neighbors, but the man next door would really like to get to know her.Hotel restaurant manager Nia Chambers got a peep show every time her next door neighbor took a shower, but she'd made a rule to never date a neighbor after her last relationship had soured and she'd had to move. So, Conn Lawler could flirt all he wanted to, but the steady stream of women to his door and Nia's ban on dating a neighbor put him squarely on her peep but don't touch list, that was until Nia's car wouldn't start.Carpenter Conn Lawler had been trying to get to know Nia Chambers for eight months. He found everything about her appealing, but Nia had ignored every neighborly overture he'd made towards her. Offering her a ride when her car wouldn't start was pretty much a dare for her to interact with him. He never expected a routine six-hour road trip in the snow would lead to overnighting with Nia in a motel and one of the hottest nights of his life. But Nia's clear that their night of passion won't lead to anything more; things will go back to the way they were when they return to their respective homes because Nia refuses to date a neighbor.But it's hard not to break the rules when the neighborly man next door is sweet, thoughtful, and nothing like the impression she'd formed of him. But Nia's looking for a man to marry and settle down with and Conn's not sold on happy ever after, even if his head and heart tell him the woman who refuses to date him is worth the fall.With the push and pull of attraction and the theme of commitment setting the tone, author Kara Doyle has penned a pleasing romance about two neighbors who have very different reasons for being gun shy with regards to the subject of love. Conn and Nia make a well-crafted and likable couple and are joined by a cast of equally likable secondary characters that bring added depth and insight to the evolving relationship dilemma. While readers can easily predict Conn and Nia will find their happily ever after, the getting there is the best part.\n",

            "I choose this rating because the book is good. What I like about the book is that Nick has his driver's license and he's not afraid to use it. But turning sixteen isn't what he thought it would be. While other boys his age are worried about prom dates and applying to college, Nick is neck-deep in enemies out to stop him from living another day. No longer sure if he can trust anyone, his only ally seems to be the one person he's been told will ultimately kill him. But life spent serving the undead is anything except ordinary. And those out to get him have summoned an ancient force so powerful even the gods fear it. As Nick learns to command and control the elements, the one he must master in order to combat his latest foe is the one most likely to destroy him. As the old proverb goes, fire knows nothing of mercy, and if Nick is to survive this latest round, he will have to sacrifice a part of himself. However, the best sacrifice is seldom the sanest move. Sometimes it's the one that leaves your enemies confused. And sometimes, you have to trust your enemy to save your friends. But what do you do when that enemy is you? What I dislike about the book is that it had a lot of pages to read. I would recommend this book to other people.\n",

This is how this book is disturbing. Much like comedy that makes you laugh because if you don't laugh you would have to really confront an issue, this book is disturbing because it puts you in a situation that as much as i don't want to believe happens, I know deep down that not only can it, but it does.I know I am a bit vague here, it is a short story and i don't want to ruin it for anyone, but it is written so well I found myself wanting to yell at the book as if I were watching a horror movie.The horror of this book is it is too easy to imagine the events actually happening. Somehow in very few pages the main character comes to vibrant life and even though you can predict that something bad will happen, you hope against hope that you are wrong and that a &#34;fairy tale&#34; ending will swoop in at the last moment and make this a happy story!Bravo, to the author. I was disturbed on so many levels.I don't recommend reading this if you are currently disgusted with humanity. I do recommend it as a must read for anyone who thinks life is just perfect and there is nothing wrong with our society, or someone who just likes to be a little introspective and doesn't mind receiving more reasons to believe their life isn't as bad as they think it is.\n",

I go to amazon on my computer and always find something very good. Also I use a &#34;kindle  and have it put right on within minutes.&#34;  Now to get to this book Shattered Sky, It starts with a B-17 and 9 man crew on their 18th. mission about to enter the Bomb Run they went to Germany to bomb, Just after dropping their load of bombs they were hit by an AA Gun firing 88mm shells. This shell explodes at a pre setting and out goes 22 pounds of steel fragments. This B-17 named &#34;RED LIGHT LADY&#34; had the misfortune of having a German 88mmm shell explode under the right wing. The explosion blew the number 4 engine right off the plane and flipped the plane up on its side and loosing altitude. The number 3 engine started acting up because it was not getting oil.As a result of damage caused the crew had to Bail out before the plane got out of control. The crew jumped out and all landed safely. The next problem was to find out where they were, Germany or France and try to get home. The crew was scattered too far at the time so they struck on their trip home in numbers of two and three. The escape was a very interesting and covered a lot of adventure. The book is well written and takes the reader through a lot of excitement. I will tell you there is not a single crew member that will leave you wondering what happened to him, If I told you any more I would be writing a book, I will tell you the survivors had  two (That I know of) reunions after the war and that will explain several things that happened. You will not have any questions when you finish. I really liked the book because I knew all when I finished and there was a lot.Col. DeVere Woods\n",

I&#8217;m not talking to you. Does it look like I&#8217;m talking to you? I&#8217;m talking about you.  That&#8217;s not the same as talking to you.Invisible is a gripping thriller frothing with suspense:  this intense and sharp page-turner from co-authors, James Patterson and David Ellis delves into the dark truths surrounding Graham&#8212; a twisted  sarcastic murderer, that turns out be more complex and calculating than any of the collective law enforcement agencies can image.  Graham cleverly uses a recording device which resembles a cell phone to record the initial meeting with the pry of the moment while walking through a crowded establishment &#8211; such as a bar &#8211; and also uses it to record the sick torturous acts of pain precisely inflicted on the chosen victims; each murder&#8217;s finale is shrewdly disguised as an undetectable arson.  As the killer continues to claim victims, FBI researcher Emmy Dockery unearths baffling clues in her search for connections among the murders . . . and while she draws closer to finding the culprit, the culprit is watching and waiting to punish her.The final chapters of the climaxed conclusion will have readers stunned and satisfied.\n",

The tales here are unique and original, each with a surprise ending that you don't expect to go the way it does.One of the things that I really liked about this compilation of stories, is that even thought they are short, the author managed to give the reader a sense of surrounding and who her characters are. I found it was easy to care about them, even in a shorter space of time than one finds in a full length book.The creativity with which these stories were written is a testament to the vibrant imagination of the author. This book takes the childhood fears as well as the more adult fears we all have at one time in our life or another and explores them in new ways.Another reason this book impressed me was that rather than just going for the fright factor, the author included other types of chills. Characters in very emotional situations gave weight to this collection that it would not have had otherwise. Fear, Sorrow,regret,sadness all work together to make this a complete book of Psychological and emotional chills.I did read this book whilst alone in the dark, and for a book entitled &#34;Chills,&#34; it certainly had the desired effect.

I was very put off by the descriptions of the rapes in prison -- way too much info and really nasty -- do we really need to hear that the ex-con had to wear a diaper because he was so torn up and infected?  Yikes!  Seriously, what does this add to the story?  Also, the killer is pretty hard to believe.  Spoiler alert -- could he really have advanced so far in the police force without someone getting wise to him?  If so, pretty heavy condemnation of the police establishment.  I also agree with some other comments that there is no really likable character in the book.  Everyone is pretty broken or unhappy or just plain nuts.

It was so great returning to the characters from the first book, and seeing what happened in their lives since we left them.I admit, I&#8217;ve gotten to love these characters so much more in this book than I did in the first one. There was so much character development, and the relationship between Drake and Lacey was so well-written. The author really succeeded in getting the emotions across to the reader, especially thanks to the alternating point of views.I really think that this book brings to light so many issues that several couples face nowadays, especially the fact the main characters are an interracial couple. The book also deals with the obstacles that couples face when in a long-distance relationship.I really liked this book much more than the first one in the series so if you enjoyed the first book, I would definitely recommend you read this one!\n",

(I could say the same of Jared Diamond's Guns but it too went off to the great library book sale in the sky).And Pinker does this in a style that is clear, concise, fresh.

I figured I'd read a couple of paragraphs and if it didn't grab me I'd jump to the next story. There was no jumping and I had great difficulty putting it down and only did so for sleep. It was a light, happy, incredibly romantic story. I'm thrilled it was in the Romance Through the Ages anthology. I have since gone back and bought some of Ms. Darcy's other books. I wish I could articulate exactly why I was so engaged to help people make informed purchasing choices. It was a happy feel good read. I enjoyed the characters. The story may have been predictable to some - personally I don't consider that a criticism in a romance book as long as I enjoy the ride - but I didn't notice because I so enjoyed the ride and wanted to see how it all played out. Oh, there was plenty of tingles, spreading heat and passionate kisses without graphic sex so that alone won my lifelong loyalty as a reader.

Furthermore, Marion Dunraven, the only sane one of the bunch and the one Olivia is inexplicable drawn to, seems captive to everyone in the dusty old house. More importantly, she doesn't expect to fall in love with Dunraven's daughter Marion.Can Olivia truly believe the stories of sadness and death that surround the house, or are they all just local neighborhood rumor?Was that carriage trouble just a coincidence or a supernatural sign to stay away? If she remains, will the Castle&#8217;s dark shadows take Olivia down with them or will she and Marion long enough to declare their love?Patty G.

He focused on the dark world of human trafficking, but he never gets preachy or political, nor does he exploit the topic gratuitously.  In PRIMAL fashion, it is what it is, and he deals with it executing a gripping story and dangerous mission around it.The recurring characters are each unique with well-developed flare.  It's like old home week reading the series and expecting that the personalities will make another appearance, which Jack routinely delivers.  Here he increases their depth, yet again.Military tactic and hardware enthusiasts have also come to expect the arsenal of toys that enable the PRIMAL team to dole out violent action justice against dregs of  humanity.  Fury does not disappoint as each action scene introduces an arsenal of goodies that will keep readers grinning across the pages.Check the box.

            "This book was just...wow. Like so many others I came to this book after Ender's Game (which I found to be a true masterpiece) and was so let down by what I found. I read the whole book hoping for it to get better, for some of the genius in Ender's Game to come through, but the story never did.First of all, this book isn't a sermon about Catholicism, it actually bashes it. A lot of it seemed to me like the author was thumbing his nose at Catholic beliefs and trying to glorify his own religion in the book. (No, I'm not Catholic) Funny how people see &#34;Catholic&#34; a few times on a page and suddenly they react like someone is trying to convert them.Anywho, there are parts of the book that work. The aliens weren't really a problem for me.  It was interesting-ish albeit slow. (Spoilers follow)  My main issue was with the characterization  of so many characters in this book. Ender has changed into this overly feeling guy. It's like the other extreme of what he was in the first book. I haven't read Ender in Exile yet, maybe that's why it's too sudden of a shift for meI was actually laughing at parts near the end where the author forces Ender and Novina together. It was like a bad soap opera or something. After knowing of the existence of a man for four days, of which you sorta spoke like two times in (both of which were quite hostile), suddenly you're all lovely dovey with him? I mean, wth? And with Ender- you see a picture of a young girl and you instantly fall in love with her and want to raise her babies as your own? And the children after having such a crappy father, after a 15 min conversation with Ender suddenly they see that he is the exact father they have always wanted? It's all just so rushed. People who have been in the situations those kids and that woman have been through need wayyy more time than that before they can learn to trust. Granted kids are prone to trust more easily than adults. It'd be a more normal reaction for them to think, &#34;he speaks the truth but he may being doing it to get something from me.&#34; Rather than living in some fairy land where all your magical dreams can come true. Too much, too soon. This book heavily needed to work on relationship growth. It's too much like a story you'd tell your kids where they all fall in love at first sight and live happily ever after. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I've never seen anything close to that in real life, which makes it lame to come across in a book for grown upsAlso, this book seemed like it needed an editor to cut down on the wordiness. Too wordy and too boring because of itSide note, those long ass names were annoying. They didn't even have much to do with the nicknames they had for most of them. It's like, why write them in?\n",

Her life is in turmoil, a long held family secret is about to be revealed that could destroy her, two sisters-she didn't know she had, is about to reveal themselves,the woman she thought and mourns for, she is soon to learn, is not her biological Mother. A heart wrenching tale, that will stay with you long after the last page, but a very compelling and loving tale of the bond between sisters. An Amish lovers dream. A very enjoyable read.

The heroine of Nicole Jordan&#8217;s Secret of Seduction is what makes this book so enjoyable. She is sweet but a little stubborn too. She knows exactly what she wants and it is the Earl of Hawkhurst who catches her entire  being.  Skye just knows they are meant to be together and she sees beyond his outward scars and realizes he needs her just as much as she needs him.  She must be smart about her plans to catch him though; she knows he is almost betrothed so her desire to be his bride must stay hidden.Lady Skye does hatch a very good plan so they can spend time together, she needs someone to help find her uncle&#8217;s long lost love.  Since Hawk is a member of the Guardian of the Swords, he has unique contacts and abilities and he is the perfect person to find the missing woman.Hawk is a noble and above all loyal hero.  He has a duty to the Guardians and he is very willing to marry the Guardian Master&#8217;s chosen bride since he has no desire to experience love again.  His wife and child were killed by a fire years earlier and he has not forgotten nor forgiven himself over their deaths.  In many ways he feels unworthy to experience happiness and love again but Skye has brought sunlight and laughter back into his life and he begins a romance that thaws his heart but also causes real turmoil.  He finds himself torn between honor and love.Nicole Jordan writes beautiful prose and her characters are fully developed.  I liked everyone in this novel including Skye&#8217;s uncle and her aunt.

            "I downloaded this book primarily because it was free, I read the blurb and was intrigued but a couple of things held me back firstly, it was a series and I'm already locked in to so many that I'm reluctant to start another, so I decided before reading that the bar was set very high on this one and I would only continue if it was in fact really good. The second thing that held me back and this I know is going to sound stupid but here goes....the good reviews, I noticed originally that none of them said Amazon verified purchase, this in itself doesn't mean anything I know I'm working my way through loads of iTunes vouchers so I often get books from there but I've been caught out a lot recently by fake reviews so it did make me stop and wonder, this is not the case here I will add.Anyway I started reading and was hooked, it's not dissimilar to a The Hunger Games in a lot of ways, that's not to say it's a copy or ripoff because it's not, this is very much it's own book. The female lead is a sixteen year old girl with no name she, like many others wears a collar or Halo around her neck to control emotions, she's trained to fight, it's all she's ever known and yes she fights to the death and feels nothing while doing it.This book is about this girl who becomes known as Kit and what happens when after feeling nothing for sixteen years she's suddenly bombarded by emotions and feelings, she's no idea what they are and how to cope with them, on top of this she finds herself in a new place where everything is different, or so it seems, it may actually have more similarities than she originally thought. There are times when Kit makes silly decisions and acts immature but it's easy to forget that's she's only sixteen and has spent sixteen years feeling nothing, as a reader I had to remind myself of this several times and ultimately only once did she make a promise and find herself in the debt of someone she really doesn't want to be in this position with and I'm really hoping, fingers crossed that the author doesn't use this 'yes' for what I think she will.So now it looks like I've added another series to my increasingly long list.\n",

The manuscript cried out for an editor who could have removed some of the cliches and the profusion of needless adjectives and adverbs. Of course, no editor could have breathed much life into the wooden characters and stilted dialogue - but that's another issue.The quality of the writing shows itself early when we learn that one character has &#34;dread etched on his face,&#34; and another &#34;burned with curiosity&#34; while a third has a mouth &#34;frozen in a crooked half smile&#34; and for a fourth, &#34;anger coursed through his body.&#34; A young girl writes in her diary that &#34;Virginie respects that which is haram or forbidden.&#34; Kind of the diarist to explain.I have to admit I did not get through this long slog set in Egypt in 1919 and 1940.

He decides to take a journey to the Shadowmyst Island and, with help of two very friendly goblins, he goes on an adventure of his life. Ethan on the other hand is constantly fighting against some very scary creatures that are dangerous to the entire kingdom.This is the first book in a series so the author does a very good job of introducing the characters and the world to us. It brings some resemblance to the books of Tolkien with the quest and introducing an evil force somewhere in the world but the similarities end there. Mark E. Lein does a fantastic job of bringing his own vision of a magical world. I really liked the creatures called Ash, they are very mysterious and I hope in the next books will be more informations about them.

            "I bought the second book first as this is the period I was most interested in and will now have to go back and read the first book last like a typical time traveler. I guess if you are a hardcore science fiction fan you know some of this, to me every few pages was a revelation as the story of Robert Heinlein's life was given context to me.Things that come to the forefront of what I learned: Heinlein's struggles with his health (I had heard of them but never knew how many he had had); the man's fight for the rights to his own work (especially unauthorized foreign editions); the games played in Hollywood;  his lifestyle at home; his work with blood donor programs; the many trips the Heinleins took; and many more events which maybe I heard of before bu now were given context.I think sometimes we have difficulty separating the life portrayed with the book that reveals it. Heinlein's politics were his politics plain and simple, you may not like them, or may have loved them but that is what they were.It was great to understand and watch how certain ideas came about and eventually became books while others became great might-have-beens. Heinlein struggles at times between illness, well meaning and not so well meaning editors and Hollywood to bring us a body of work that is indeed grand. Well worth the time and effort of any reader interested in the lives of Robert and Virginia Heinlein.\n",

Courageous and clever, she serves as a messenger for her clan's warriors and helps an imprisoned warrior, Logan, escape from a brutal captor's dungeon. Despite the dangers they face during a time of rebellion, love blooms between Lindsey and Logan, but as an illegitimate son, Logan believes he can never have the woman he loves for his own. I greatly enjoyed reading Lindsey and Logan's love story. Lindsey is a strong, intelligent heroine, and Logan is rugged, appealing, and honorable. &#34;Lindsey&#34; is a terrific Scottish historical romance that blends a love story with adventure.\n",

            "Reviewed by JenBook provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookLet me start out by saying that I love Donna Kauffman. Her writing style and story telling skills just draw me in to the tale and just won&#8217;t let me go. And having read the first book in this series, Sugar Rush, and loving the community she was creating, I couldn&#8217;t wait to get started on Sweet Stuff.This story starts shortly after the Sugar Rush ends and features Riley who made a small appearance in that prior book. And from page one, I was in stitches laughing at Riley&#8217;s klutziness, perhaps because I could totally relate. But it also made her more believable. Yes, she&#8217;s an attractive women. But she&#8217;s also clumsy, not stick thin and a little awkward when it comes to dealing with a man she&#8217;s attracted to. And she&#8217;s also dealing with having been betrayed from her fiancee. As the story progressed, I found myself rooting her on and anxiously awaiting her &#8220;ah ha&#8221; moment so we could have our happily ever after.Enter into the picture Riley. He&#8217;s a famous author who has come to this small island community in South Carolina to clear his mind and work on his new novel. Little does he realize that his world is going to be shaken up when he meets Riley. Quinn is your typical romance hero&#8230; you know the type. They&#8217;re rich or famous (or both), quite handsome and sometimes just too good to be true. But that didn&#8217;t stop me from perhaps just falling a little in love with Quinn myself as I read his love story with Riley. His understanding of Riley and her insecurities, but his persistence with her when she&#8217;s keeping him at a distance just had me turning the pages.The plot of this book is really just the romance. There&#8217;s no grand mystery or bad guy in the wings. There are some minor subplots that enhance the story, but Sweet Stuff is all about the character development as they work toward their happily ever after. And I was honored to go along for the ride.As this book is part of the Cupcake Club series, we&#8217;re also treated with a couple recipes for the reader to enjoy. How does Reverse Caramel Apple Cupcakes or Sweet Peach Tea Cupcakes sound?I honestly can&#8217;t wait for the next book in this series, Babycakes, which will be released in October. The book does stand alone, but has characters from Sugar Rush do make appearances in Sweet Stuff, reading the series in order does make the experience a little more enhanced.\n",

This guy knows how to write in first person and build scenes tangible enough for the reader to stand and look around in.Jacobi's prosthetic is a nifty, er, hook that differentiates him from the ex-cop detective pack. Thanks to Matthews's writing, I believed every move Jacobi made and every thought that he had--and he had plenty of deep ones.

            "The Second Deadly Sin is set in northern Sweden and opens with the hunt for a wounded bear.  When it is finally brought down, the hunters make a grisly discovery. The story then moves to the seemingly disconnected but equally horrific murder of a woman and her missing grandson. Prosecutor Rebecka Martinsson is initially assigned to the case but a less skilled but extremely ambitious rival manages to claim it for himself. Martinsson refuses to take a less important case and instead decides to take her vacation time. However, she can't let it go. She discovers there are threads tying the bear hunt and the murder together and that they may also be linked to other sudden and unexplained deaths.The novel alternates between Martinsson's investigations in the present and the story of the love affair between a young school teacher and an important mining official in the years leading up to WWI and the subsequent unsolved murder of the teacher.  As Martinsson digs deeper, she begins to suspect that these events of the past are somehow related to those in the present and that, if she doesn't solve the case quickly, there will be more deaths.This is the fifth in this series by Swedish author Asa Larsson but it is the first I have read and it worked very well as a standalone. Larsson has a deft hand with descriptions of both time and place. Her forays into the past are very well written and seem likely to be true to the time period including her portrayal of the pre-WWI cultural and class values. The story is both intelligent and suspenseful and, like so many of the thrillers coming out of the Scandinavian countries, very dark.  But it is with her characters where Larsson shines.  She has created a group of memorable characters who are at once sympathetic and flawed and who make us care about what happens to them. Best of all, I never guessed who the murderer was until the big reveal at the end, something that happens too rarely. Definitely a high recommendation from me especially for fans of Nordic Noir.\n",

            "I received a copy via Edelweiss for an honest review.Before I begin writing my review, let me just make this very, very clear for you prospective readers: Lauren Oliver's Panic is NOT a dystopian novel. It is contemporary (set in the present time) and holds a handful of mystery and suspense, but there are not characteristics of it being a dystopian novel.I've found myself on the fence regarding Oliver's writing more than once. While I absolutely loved Before I Fall, which was her debut, I couldn't get through Delirium. As for Panic, I had quite a bit of mixed feelings. While there were moments that made me itch to continue reading the novel, other instances had me physically pushing it away. The pacing is irregular, but still good, and the concept of the novel is fantastic. But like with Delirium (at least for me), I felt like the idea was just a tad too large for Oliver to handle.The earlier stages of the novel were actually good, if not at times confusing, since the narrative tended to deviate from the norm, and I felt like sharing with you guys how I liked what I was reading so far (hence the pictures on my blog.) But as the story reached its halfway point, I started noticing little bits and pieces that were actually a bit annoying. It was so cool to see such intense challenges, and even a few terrifying ones that I couldn't really read because they freaked me out, but I felt like the dramatic subplots overshadowed the premise of the novel.Perhaps one of the most intriguing, and best choices in regards to this novel, was how the narrative was split into two characters, Heather and Dodge. These two personalities clashed on so many levels that I decided to just use it as a way to see how Oliver could manage a male character as opposed to a female character. I'm going to let you in on a little secret that I've come to realize after finishing this novel: Oliver can be great at writing powerful male protagonist with big personalities, but she struggles with the female characters. And before I have some of you telling me, &#34;Oh but being weak is a characteristic in some characters,&#34; being written in a weak fashion does not mean it is a characteristic, it simply means that the character is hard to relate to and/or accept as a trustworthy voice of a story.Heather was, for me, slightly reminiscent of Lena and if you've read my review of Delirium, then you know that's not a good thing for me. Sure, she had a tough life, but she was so frustrating that I almost started yelling at her. Dodge, on the other hand, was a character that had a lot of fire in him. He was daring, almost callous in his descriptions, and I was frankly surprised that Oliver had it in her to introduce such an extreme character. But I liked him and I think he is perhaps one of the saving graces of this novel.The conclusion felt abrupt and a bit too easy. Things were left unfinished and I felt like the story was building up to this huge ending but what I actually got felt a bit lackluster. &#60;SPOILER&#62;Suddenly everything is fixed and everyone is happy? That makes no sense--it's like a chunk of the story was left out. Reality doesn't depict characters suddenly being ok with each other without hashing things out. &#60;/SPOILER&#62;I'm curious to see what Oliver comes up with next. I'm hoping that in the future I'll have the opportunity to read something like Before I Fall again. I loved the near simplicity of how our actions affect not just our lives, but the lives around us. With Panic, it almost felt like it was the creation of someone who was trying a little bit too hard--and if that sounds harsh, I apologize, but I'm upset that something that started out so great, turned into a weird, weak, and confusing mess.I recommend this one for readers looking for a different kind of read. If you like contemporary suspense or mystery, you might like this. The point is, this is my opinion and I am not the voice for every reader. So, while I only enjoyed this a smidgen, others might love this one.\n",

            "An apocalyptic thriller that is revolves around change and catharsis, Rag Men develops like a blizzard; the snow falls slowly at first, but its intensity ratchets up engulfs those who stand witness.Rag Men revolves around the development of two men, Rooster and Ross, who are polar opposites; their stories parallel each other, and the craftsmanship involved in this component is indicative of Rocky Alexander&#8217;s ability to write a compelling story; the characters&#8217; actions and attitudes are presented in stark contrast. We have two different stories in the same timeline, and these stories ultimately converge, as the reader would expect.The zombie scenario serves as the catalyst behind character development. We have your disaster scenario and the coping mechanisms of a population, though it&#8217;s reduced to a microcosm through the perspectives of two characters. Ross represents the moral dissolution that may be required to survive in such a scenario, while Rooster represents the chaos itself. There is a lot of depth in these characters, and further discussing their metamorphosis would spoil the novel.There are plenty of scenes that include graphic violence and some disgusting truths. Rocky Alexander provided several moments were survival skills and a degree of common sense betrayed an amount of painstaking care that was applied to this story. Fans of apocalyptic-survival scenarios will find plenty to love here. The zombies themselves are a serious threat; the amount of detail used to describe them heightens the tension, especially when Alexander uses the plague/germ idea to indicate that everything and anything can be dangerous.Ross&#8217;s iron will and determination made him a compelling character, especially during the unforgettable trek through a wintry land. We have the symbolic battle against nature in addition to an unnatural phenomenon, which nicely fits the two personalities that define this book.An excellent tale of survival horror that that will stick with you long after the story has ended.\n",

One day, he asks her a special favor: go back in time, via his own invention, and change his destiny; a destiny that lands him in a wheelchair.How can she deny him this one thing? Her adventure back is eye-opening. Everything she thought she understood about their life together is upended.Time travel is a tricky subject. No matter how well explained it is, the potential paradox problems are too often glaring. So it takes a good story to make the reader forget all of that. Thus is the case here. I was caught up in Claudia and Adam's love story. What began as a light story quickly became more complex: some things are simply meant to happen, no matter how much we think changing them would improve our lives.Claudia is an endearing character; she's hurting from unfulfilled expectations--she thought she'd be a wife and mother by now--and fighting to get back what she thinks she's lost. Adam, who at first seems distant, comes full circle through the revelations of time travel. Thanks to strong emotions, it develops into a sweet (just the right amount, not overly sweet) romance.If you enjoy a romance with an interesting twist, I recommend The Time Traveler's Boyfriend.Note: I received a complimentary copy for review purposes.

Always fun-filled, full of action, and loaded with real down-to-earth characters, these books are ones I always look forward to reading.Stephanie is still bounty hunting for her cousin Vinnie.  She enjoys her job, but feels she is getting nowhere in her career.  Stephanie wonders if it may be time to hang up her stun gun and hand cuffs for a different type of employment.  She also feels the same way about the two men in her life, Joe Morelli and Ranger.  While she feels as if she is 'practically engaged' to Joe, neither of them can make a commitment to each other and prefer to just keep exclusively dating.  However, Stephanie has the hots for Ranger -- as do all of the women who lay eyes on him -- and the two worlds tend to collide.Murder is involved in this book -- elderly women are being found in dumpsters and Ranger is devoted to finding out who is responsible.  Of course, Stephanie is dragged into the scenario and chaos, action, and fun abound. Then there are the bounty hunting situations that are always fun and different.  The entire gang is back -- Grandma -- who is always hysterical -- Lula -- who is also always hysterical -- Morelli, Ranger, Vinnie, Connie, and a host of new characters that will leave you laughing.  Even though you pretty much know where the road is going, the journey is fun and worth the read.My only wish -- along with others -- is that Stephanie would make a decision regarding the men in her life.  However, I personally feel that this choice will not happen until the last installment of these books.  Makes me wonder how many more books in this series Evanovich has up her sleeve.I definitely will be along for the ride.  I love the characters, the situations, the dialogue, and everything about these books.  They are light, easy to enjoy and read, and just down right fun.  Yes, they are repetitive, yes, they are pretty much the same old same old -- but to me, this is life as it truly is.  Take these books for what they are and just enjoy them.If you want some fun, start with ONE FOR THE MONEY and work your way up to the latest, TAKEDOWN TWENTY.Thank you.Pam\n",

            "This is an endearing tale of two brothers who just want to have a day of fun. Being the children of an alcoholic father places them at a disadvantage in society, through no fault of their own. Bette Stevens explores unspoken and often hidden prejudices that pervade society. Though the story is set in the 1950&#8217;s, one can still relate to the experiences that the two boys go through, as they still exist today. Look around you, there is poverty, bullying and misery marring our world. So, really nothing much has changed since then.Pure Trash is a heartbreaking story of innocence stolen, as the children do not understand the reasons for people&#8217;s attitude towards them. All they wanted to do was go out and have a day of fun. The book moved me tears at times, gave me goose bumps and made me angry at the cruelty of human beings. I look forward to reading the sequel. An exceptional book, Bette!\n",

The author is knowledgeable about both psychology and archeology, both of which figure heavily in the books as well as an interesting amount of shared history by People of the Book.  The twists and turns of the plot kept me reading. I found the books more enjoyable if I did not keep track of how close the end of the book was.\n",

            "I was really in the mood for a paranormal/angel story and this book sounded like a good one, so I gave it a chance. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book, but there doesn't seem to be much of a paranormal story line, other than a few of the characters. Nothing seems to happen except for everything that she is going through in her school life. Grace is also hard to like, in my opinion. She does have a good side, but she is overly dramatic and has a bit of a temper problem that comes in the strangest of places. A lot of times she gets so angry over such a minor detail it just doesn't really make sense. I have to say though, I haven't finished reading the book entirely, I'm about 80% of the way through..and still waiting for the paranormal aspect to come through. For example (possible spoiler alert), her powers. We know that she is basically an empath when she touches someone, but that's it? Are there more powers? I would think there would be because of who she is..same with Quinten, what about his powers? And, Darius? Who is Darius? We don't learn enough about the other characters. The entire book seems to be about Grace, her drama and her friends. It's worth reading if you're not trying to read a book about angels, but if you are, you may want to find another book. All of that being said, I will finish it and I may read the sequel..with the hope that paranormal aspect will be brought out in the second book.\n",

I guess because I love the Canterbury Tales and the supernatural aspect of these novels makes them different from the excellent Hugh Corbett books.  The downside is that, with so many irons in the fire, they come out irregularly and may never be wrapped up.  If so, that is unfortunate, but doesn't keep the individual novels, which all stand alone rather well, from being well written and enjoyable.  I also heartily recommend his Egyptian series.\n",

            "Daisies are Forever by Liz Tolsma is a historical fiction written during WWII. What drew me to the book in the first place was the beautiful cover art. Then I read the description.... and it drew me in to the story.I have to admit... this was a hard book for me to read.  First, I think it was because I don't know my history as well as I should and so, quite a bit of the information was new to me.  Second, it was hard because sometimes the story was just confusing.  The main character, Gisela, was the one telling the story, but sometimes... I just could understand what she was trying to say or how what she was saying fit into the story.  Also, some of the dialog seemed stale... it had no real emotion or creativity to it.  There was also an overall lack of God mentioned.  I was surprised by this on the one hand, but because of things I have recently heard from different authors, not at all surprised as it seems that publishing companies want authors to &#34;tone down&#34; the &#34;christianese&#34; and biblical references in their books so they can reach more people.  Given that knowledge, the book works... it still has a Christian thread, but not so overwhelming and in-your-face that it would turn most people off.Overall, the story is beautiful and sad with a somewhat happy ending (it was WW2, of course, there was sadness).  Gisela and Mitch are both brave, but circumstances often force them to question the decisions they make in the heat of necessity. They are drawn to each other as their journey continues, but there are stumbling blocks along the way -- fear, Kurt and Audra, and uncertainty about the future.  Eventually, they each find the faith they need and with it the hope they need to survive the world at its darkest hour.\n",

A lot of aggravation could be solved if they would only talk to each other truthfully -- as my grandfather always says, &#34;there's no communication&#34;. It's a sad book that's written well. A certain important scene was very disturbing. I look forward to more books from this author.PS: I know it's a tiny town, but do women really still (in the 1990s)not get prenatal care from an OB and deliver at home? Why didn't Lila go to a hospital? Nobody in this book goes to a real doctor. Why don't people get air conditioners? And have you ever seen teens without cell phones?

            "This is the first read for me by this author, she hasn't written that many books but she's certainly very talented. This story set in the twelfth century is a tale of love, murder and betrayal. Robert de Langley the Lion of Normandy is determined to regain his lands and properties back from a Norman knight William Montagne. While William is off to meet the king Robert takes his chance, and pretending to be delivering supplies he gains entrance to the castle which very quickly falls to him. Williams youngest daughter Jocelyn is brave and not the slightest bit afraid to stand up to Robert. Her two siblings Brian and Adelise are older. But Brian is with their father. Adelise although older and considered more beautiful than the dark and exotic Jocelyn, is reduced to constant bouts of crying leaving Jocelyn to deal with the invaders alone.Jocelyn had never been her fathers favourite, she was the child of his much despised second wife. In fact he treats Jocelyn little better than a servant. She's attracted to Robert, but when King Stephen hears of the escalating trouble he arrives and pronounces a solution. Robert will marry William's eldest daughter. But Adelise is horrified and runs away. So Robert is forced to marry Jocelyn.While this is really well researched and written, it's meant to be a romance and to a degree it is. But the author seems more preoccupied with the historical details happening at that period in history and the fight for the throne of England between King Stephen and Henry of Anjou (the future Henry II). I did like the two main characters  but any problems between them were to quickly glossed over SPOILER...... Shortly after their marriage while Robert is staying elsewhere Jocelyn arrives and finds another woman in his bed. His excuse given to Jocelyn was  &#34;she was there and she was attractive, but I only thought about you&#34; the matter was immediately forgotten, really! It was things like that I didn't like. But I still thought that overall this is a good book, more so if you're really into this period in history, as there's plenty of detail.\n",

            "The book cover and title are magnificent, the contents are not.  While readers who are new to the NYC culture will find the general details in the book somewhat interesting, I suspect that the more seasoned ones will conclude otherwise. I was drawn in by the possibility of receiving a broad understanding of what goes on in the \"underground economy\" of NY. Instead what I got was a narrow synopsis of the author's interaction with a few people in the world of drugs, prostitution, and porn videos.Though the author notes at the end of the book that this is just his memoir, the contents lack a lot of things that a reader would want to know- general information on the history of the NY underground, some stats on what the underground really consists of, greater details on the wealth/poverty divide, etc). Instead what we get is prolonged details of shallow events and conversations. The book seems more like one that (as the author implies a few times) was meant to keep him busy with a project at a difficult time in his life.One element that I felt uncomfortable with throughout the book was the author's statement that he needed to be non judgmental when interacting with the underworld. Odd to use ones profession and academia as a crutch when the kinds of activities that the people he interacts with are destructive to self and society. How does one walk away from human interactions like this as if it were an experiment/analysis conducted in a lab? Should one even do such experiments/analysis? Undoubtedly his work will inspire others to pursue the same line of investigation. But I would suggest that this is best left to the NYPD who surely have a much deeper grasp of the NY underworld and whose purpose is much more nobler - the maintenance of law and order in Gotham. Maybe the NYPD should write a book on the NY underground!\n",

Jack's on the home stretch of studying while Lily still has a couple of years to go, and they're wondering where they go from here. Whatever happens they want a future together but then Life throws that spanner in. Poor Jack &#8211; something happens that's a nightmare for him and spirals him into despair again, and Lily and Alana need to help him get back out of his depression. Its something they've all feared with Jack's history and it has a huge impact on all of them.This is really sensitively done and handled. Having been in a similar depression in the past I can relate to the musings on suicide. Falling from a height &#8211; con= may not die but just end up worse off. Drowning = tough to do, takes time. Drugs = which ones,  how many, and would it again leave worse off from other damage if failed. Bleeding = needs clear action and takes time. All these thoughts are familiar to anyone depressed, and when they crop up in the book they make it feel so so real.Lily, she's so in love but struggles to help Jack, but is determined she won't let him down. She loves him and just wants to help him work through this and be with her. He's convinced he's not good enough, and she needs to make him understand he's all she wants. I felt for her, so upset in this book over things she couldn't control.Its not all doom and gloom though, but shows how to shine a light through that darkness and follow it. Its a perfect ending and I look forward to the next book with them in, Ambrosia.Stars: Four and a half. Tough, gritty read at times, real life, real drama but thankfully real love too and that wins through.ARC supplied by author\n",

I enjoyed the book, but I wanted more.  The story needed more.  I loved the h and H.  Two amazing characters.  I felt the love for them.  The content is disturbing, as the warning says.  The h is taken, gang raped, beaten, tortured, disfigured and other things are done to leave her for dead.  I will say this...I was glad the author did not give us it as it was happening.  I didn't want that detailed.  What we do learn about what happened to her was horrific, but the author gave it to us in pieces.  I was glad she did it that way.  The h is just one strong, amazingly determined woman.  The H, her doctor, was an amazing man.  Wow, we all need a Dominic.  I guessed the twists as soon as the other characters were introduced.  Therefore, it was not a big twist for me.  It was predictable.  This story had the potential, for me, to be a 5* read.  It needed to be longer to let it progress in an appropriate manner.  The relationships needed to be built more slowly.  The other conflicts needed more attention.  The epilogues for each convicted assailant was interesting, but I felt it was not enough of me seeing justice for the h.  I especially wanted to see what happened to the &#34;ring leader.&#34;  I also wanted to see some of the beautiful moments from the H and H in the epilogue in a bit more detail.

            "Being an avid reader, it is rare that a book's story arc takes me by surprise. In Jasinda Wilder's outstanding Alpha, I found an exception.Alpha was riveting, captivating, enchanting and sexy. I was enthralled and spellbound from beginning to end because of the originality of plot, the character development, pacing, and the sizzling sex scenes that were truly masterpieces.Written in first person in the heroine's POV, time was taken to establish the intellectual, emotional and physical draw between the Valentine Roth and Kyrie St Claire. Thereby making the attraction credible and completely believable. I love that Wilder took time to establish that, all the while providing tantalising sensual tension. Her books are downright sexy, but it's not all about the sex. Alpha was all about the journey to love against the odds. The impossible relationship possible. Not a neatly tied bow of sunshine & roses. Two untrusting, isolated souls finding completion, trust, connection.You will love the characters. You will love the strength of the heroine, her intellect, her natural charm and beauty, her intuitive nature, all untarnished by her dilapidated life circumstances. And the sensationally sexy Hero? I loved the man, and not just his exceptionally talented tongue. Cough. (Even the first kisses will leave you breathless.) His intensity, his charm, his patience, his passion for Kyrie, his humble arrogance, which I know sounds obscure, but that was Roth. He was untrusting, yet devoted: a contradiction. The pairing? Shouldn't make sense, but they did. True compatibility.I now have another favourite Jasinda Wilder chapter. Chapter 10. Chapter 10 of Alpha. Wow. Mind you, then there was 11 & 12...And then the twist. Of all the scenarios I'd imagined, the actual incident was unexpected. But it was also handled so well; intelligently, logically, credibly.This was a book I would read again. In fact, I read it twice before this review. Completely enamoured. Make sure you wait for the bonus scene at the end. Not. To. Be. Missed. Yum.Thank you Mrs Wilder for a skilfully constructed story, a breathtaking escape from reality, believable, wonderful characters, and erotic, jaw-dropping schmexy. To readers: Enjoy devouring Alpha.\n",

            "Rose is a typist in the local police precinct. It is 1923, and Rose records testimonies that no women should have to hear.  With Rose's background as a orphan, being raised by nuns, and having to work hard for everything she has, she takes nothing for granted and follows all the rules of society.  That is until Odalie, the new typist at the precinct walks into her life.  Odalie lives in a fancy hotel, has men falling at her feet, and gets everything she wants with a wink of her eye.  Rose immediately falls under Odalie's spell and their friendship turns Rose into someone she no longer recognizes.Now, I have to stop here, after my brief synopsis of the book and tell you that I did not finish the book.  I tried.  I gave it several hours and days.  I got to Chapter 9 and page 130 and I just couldn't go any farther. This doesn't happen to me very often because I really feel like I am a pretty good judge of &#34;book character&#34;. But, this one just didn't do it for me.  I was bored and felt like I was forced to read.  I have a &#34;rule&#34; that if I'm not enjoying my reading, I need to quit the book because I have too many other books to read.So, with that in mind, I can only offer you that hundreds of other people have LOVED this book. There are rave reviews for THE OTHER TYPIST. There are also several others who have felt the same way I did.  But, as a book blogger, I am not going to lie or tell you that I liked something when I didn't. It just didn't work for me.Some things I did like though were the author's character descriptions.  I had no trouble imagining Rose or Odalie, the Sergeant or the Lieutenant Detective, or Dotty and Helen from the boarding house where Rose lived.  Rindell's details of the 1920's, the expectations of women, and descriptions of those trying to break out of those expectations depicted an era that showed how difficult it was for Rose to find a way to fit in.  Even though I couldn't find a way to be interested in the story, I found several quotes from the book that I enjoyed.If it were not for the fact that they need so much typing done and cannot do it themselves, there would be no women employed at all. The typewriter is indeed my passport into a world otherwise barred to me and my kind.  Page 3So it's strange to me that with Odalie, I suddenly found myself breaking the rules I had once held in such precious regard....The thing about rules is that when you break one, it is only a matter of time before you break more, and the severe architecture that once protected you is destined to come crashing down about your ears.  Pages 119-120THE OTHER TYPIST has also been optioned for film produced by and starring Keira Knightley. I would actually be interested in seeing the movie.\n",

            "Nabila stepped it up in this one I think. Both in terms of writing, art, and the message being sent. All slight improvements over the first book, which is saying something because I absolutely adored book one. There is just something really amazing about this author and the way they deliver this kind of information. As an adult I was sucked into the story and I couldn't leave it until there was no more story to read. It left me thinking about our world and what we do to it. It makes me a little sad. I hope children everywhere get a chance to read this, especially while the wonders showed in the book still exist. I hope they can read it as an adult and the same could be true.These are the types of books that inspire young ones to become marine biologists, or exploration, archaeology, etc. These are the types of books that inspire them to get a higher education in a field that hardly anyone goes into anymore. For that alone I want to give it 5 stars... and then another 5 because it's done it in what I consider such an amazing way.Thank you Nabila, for another amazing book.

            "This review applies to &#34;Space Vengeance&#34;, book three in the Scrapyard Ship series as read on Kindle.In my previous review on &#34;Hab 12&#34;, I indicated the Author was vacillating entirely too much between actual &#34;Sci-Fi&#34; and Fantasy, and should tighten-up his story-telling; this he has failed to do, and in fact has grown worse.&#34;Science&#34; entails the study of known, provable phenomena; whereas &#34;fantasy&#34; does not. &#34;Science-Fiction&#34; postulates scientifically POSSIBLE phenomena which does not yet exist, but may at some point in the future should our scientific knowledge make it so. Too much of what Mr. McGinnis puts forth as &#34;Science-Fiction&#34; is actually &#34;fantasy&#34; since the known laws of science make it impossible. Entertaining fantasy, but NOT &#34;Sci-Fi&#34;.Additionally, I am left to wonder how much (if any) actual military experience Mr. McGinnis has. I am sure that I am not the only veteran who laughed at the ridiculously naive ideas the Author displays as to how the military, especially the Naval branches, work.When you couple the above mentioned military ignorance with his obvious left-wing political bias, which he really makes apparent in this book, you have one man's fantasy about a world and &#34;multiverses&#34; he wished could exist, but never has or will. I mean really... The &#34;Montana Militia&#34; backing a rogue FEMALE Admiral's attempted coup to overthrow the government?!  Laughably ridiculous! The Author seems to know even less about militia groups (especially that one), than he does about the US military! Such propaganda narratives are blown apart by the simple fact that it has been the Leftist extremist groups such as &#34;Red Flag&#34;, the &#34;Weathermen&#34;, and the so-called &#34;People's Liberation&#34; armies of men like Mao, Lenin, and Castro, who throughout history  have been responsible for the bloodiest coups in man's history. How many violent coups have the American militia groups ever attempted? ZERO. How many have Leftist? Numerous.I think it despicable when Writers of a genre of literature, which should be safe from political propaganda use it as a pulpit to propagate their own twisted mis-characterizations. Mr. McGinnis - If your readers want to entertain a political treatise, there are much better source Authors they could resort to. I, like so many others, buy Sci-Fi books seeking a temporary escape from such ugly real-world  concerns. It violates the whole intent of such escapist literature to inject your own political biases into it, much like defecating in the swimming pool; and soon you'll find good folks electing to swim elsewhere.You want to air your views on politics? Fine, but do it within that genre where it may be properly critiqued as such, and rebutted by others.Finally, whereas the Author seems to be a Leftist in other respects, he certainly embraces capitalism where his own financial interests are concerned. These books are becoming thinner (both literally and figuratively) with every issue, and it does seem that the Author is attempting to &#34;milk it&#34; for all he can. No &#34;Tolkein&#34; is he, for sure.I was probably a sucker to buy his third installment in the vain hopes that things would improve; they haven't. So, this will be my last purchase from this Author.I hope others will find this review helpful.\n",

            "I really enjoyed this one.  One, because we got to see little Vinny (the young teenager Nico was trying to save in Worth the Fight) all grown up.  And two, because Vinny was hard not to love...controlling, dominating fighter with his issues and all.Liv and Vinny have history.  Seven years ago, in high school, she was the brainiac girl who tutored Vinny in English.  He always seemed to have a girl on his arm, but soon his attention turned to her.  Liv loved Vinny's attention and thought they had something, but he walked away and broke her heart.  So imagine her surprise when she discovers her assignment from the newspaper she's interning at is to interview a hot MMA star...Vince.  They do a good job of reconnecting, but then Vince's past plays it hand and causes the two of them to fight for  their relationship.I loved Liv.  There was just something about the bookworm, wallflower type getting the hot, alpha male everyone else wants that made me happy.  She struggled with her feelings for Vinny, because she was so afraid she was going to get her heart broken again, but she threw caution to the wind because being with Vinny made her happy.  And then you felt badly for her when she was put in the ugly position to write the story about the Senator that was going to hurt Vinny so badly.  Her emotions, her turmoil leapt off the pages at you and made you want to put your arms around her and tell her it's going to to be ok.Vinny was everything you'd want a hot, sexy, MMA fighting alpha male to be.  He was dominant and could urke the hell out of you, but he had a sweet, protective side that made you want to be the one Vinny stood on guard for.  But Vinny had his own set of issues.  His drug addict mother continues to cause his life to be one step away from disaster, even when he's trying to keep himself on the straight and narrow.  You feel for him and understand why he can't walk away from the only parent he's ever known, but there comes a point when you want him to do just that and think about himself and what he needs.Vi Keeland is fast becoming one of those authors on my auto-buy list.  She creates these wonderful characters that are so easy to connect with...even with all their issues.  Couple that with engaging storylines and you find it very hard to put your e-reader down.

            "First and foremost, this was one of those books where I started it, set it aside without finishing, formed my opinion on how I thought it was going to be. I then got the idea to buy it for my husband since it has many things he likes from movies - cars, action, international intrigue and espionage. Now, my husband isn't an avid reader. He's got many a hobby, books are probably the last thing on his list of &#34;fun things&#34; (he's slowly crossing over to the good side, though). For him to pick it up and do a marathon reading of it, and then to encourage me to finish it made me think I was too hasty to set it aside. At his urging, I started it again and have never been more surprised. This book was definitely worlds better than the preconceived notions I had for it. I normally don't fancy books with non-stop action and stories where the characters jump continents on what seems like a never-ending chase. Now I can throw that idea out the window and expand my horizons because it turns out I do like them :)Lucas Soul is an immortal, a half-breed. A product of his parents' forbidden relationship. His father descends from the Crovirs, his mother from the Bastians. The Crovirs and the Bastians are the only immortals on earth, and they have been fighting for millennia. Hunters are tasked with finding the half-breeds and killing them. Most of them don't last long, Lucas being the exception. He's also hunted for another reason - he is feared because of a certain &#34;gift&#34; he possesses. Lucas now resides in Boston, running a PI company with his partner, Reid. Reid is a former Marine and a former cop, and one of the few humans who know truly what Lucas is.The story starts immediately with action. Lucas dies his 15th death, which isn't a good thing. The immortals aren't completely immortal after all. They can only survive up to 17 deaths before they are gone for good. Lucas and Reid now embark on an international chase, running from both hunters and dangerous men who are also after the same thing they are.I loved the idea of immortals actually having a mortal side. I suppose that as long as they're careful, they can live long and prosper. Lucas isn't careful. I also love the bits of history woven into the story. Starrling based many of her events on factual historical events, and you can tell she took great care to properly research different aspects and pull together a great story. I also loved the action. In the beginning, I found the action to be a bit tedious. It seemed like Lucas and Reid were running for no purpose. Had I initially continued just a bit further, I would have learned a bit more of the how's and why's they are on an wild goose chase that leads them from several cities in the US over to Europe.I really enjoyed this story after giving it a second chance. I would have surely been missing out if I went with my initial thoughts on the book and decided not to finish it at all.

            "(3 & 1/2 stars)There are many things to admire about author Donnie Eichar and his work in writing Dead Mountain.  It is a kind of &#34;cold case&#34; forensics saga, as Eichar set out to solve the half-century-old mystery of what happened to an experienced of college students who were experienced hikers but somehow all perished in the &#34;Dyatlov Pass Incident.&#34;  The book alternates between chapters describing the author's expeditions to Russia to retrace the hikers' trip and his attempts to figure out why they died, and chapters telling about the 1959 Dyatlov trip and the official investigation immediately following the group's disappearance.  All of it is relatively interesting, but the sense of mystery is sapped out of the story by too much detail about Eichar's research steps and methodology.  Then, the hiker's part of the story never gets very compelling until the last chapter, which is Eichar's speculative reconstruction of the hiker's final hours, including what happened to them and how it happened.There isn't much wrong with Mr. Eichar's writing style, which is well suited to the tale he tells.  He incorporates moments of humor, and does a moderately good job of capturing the different personalties of the hikers (although, strangely, the leader of the group, Igor Dyatlov, for whom the pass was later named, seems almost invisible throughout much of the book!).  Perhaps Eichar's greatest enemy in writing a memorable book about the Incident is that there was really only enough strong material for a fantastic magazine article, but not for an entire book.  I don't think there's much the author could do about that situation, although some editing and focus issues contributed to the problem.\n",

So that's a plus.But if you read Slammed and Hopeless by Colleen Hoover, very little about this book will be new to you.  I'm not sure if it was intentional, and it's not my place to assume it was.  As a friend of mine says, &#34;there are only so many story lines, eventually a couple of books are going to resemble each other.&#34;  That's true, but I have a laundry list of similarities that I won't post here as to avoid spoilers.  There were at least a dozen times that I found myself saying, &#34;Wait....that's from Slammed&#34;.  Or &#34;Wait...that happened in Hopeless&#34;.  It disappointed me that the true originality didn't come in until closer to the end.There were also some character development issues.  For instance, at the beginning, her dad comes across as a pot head whose car is a piece of junk.  Wait...he's the assistant principal?  That threw mw for a loop.  And Ryan is initially presented as a brooding teenager who doesn't so much as speak to Ashlyn. But on the first day of school, he's all smiley and talkative and BFFs with her.  How did that happen?Overall, I enjoyed the read, which I guess is the purpose.  I just don't know if I can overlook the above issues to say it was great.\n",

            "As I read Blind Descent, the testimony of climber Brian Dickinson who survived alone and BLIND on Mount Everest, I was reminded of God&#8217;s unfailing love for his children.  Through this story, I learned a great deal about the science of climbing Mt. Everest.  During his journey to the summit, Dickinson became snow blind. This phenomenon occurs due to exposure to intense UV rays &#8212; basically a sunburn on the cornea. As awful as that sounds, how much worse is having it occur on top of Mt. Everest while you are ALONE? The thought makes my heart skip a beat. How many times have I felt spiritually snow blind? Unable to see beyond the reflection of the symbolic snow falling all around me, feeling alone and afraid? This is something that many people can understand, if not as a climbing experience but as a spiritual pain. From this book, I received a great deal of comfort knowing that God loves his children no matter where they are on Earth. I mean that both geographically and spiritually. There is nowhere you can go where God cannot be with you, from the highest point on Earth to the darkest part of your soul. No matter what is your Mt. Everest, God can help you overcome. Allow him into your heart and you&#8217;ll never be alone again.  Tyndale House Publishers  provided me with a complimentary copy of this book. The opinions shared here are 100% mine.\n",

            "I think this book is very similar to the Fables graphic novel, which is basically like fairy tale characters living in modern day society, mingling with humans and acclimating to their new life. Obviously, the plot is a little different, but the gist is the same. I particularly love rewritten fairy tales, which is why I gave this 4 stars, but that may just be my own book genre bias. The reason I don't give it 5 is because the character development was PRETTY weak. Mina Grime and the cast of characters that come in later don't have very strong personas, which made some of her actions seem kind of random. Also, very big/weird events were described super fast and in vague-ish detail. I'm pretty imaginitive and I would read through the paragraphs describing secret passages, and I'd have to reread it again because I couldn't really draw up any kind of picture from her description. The story is still fun and there are little mini twists, which keep things interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the Grimm tales or the Fables comics.\n",

            "Madeline Hunter is a truly wonderful writer. The prose flows beautifully and effortlessly, and I am a fan. Her characters are generally rich and complex, with much more seething under the surface than what is visible to the outside world. Her characters are rich in emotion and her writing is unique.Unfortunately, the plot and the characters in this novel are not all that interesting, I am sad to report. This is the last book in the series and it just fell a little flat.  Lydia the h has been introduced in prior books and we know that something is wrong with her. Her personality has changed and she has become almost addicted to gambling.  The rest of the time she is moping about. We find out here that Lydia thought she was in love with/had a crush on the man Penthurst the Duke H killed in a duel. This duel as we know from prior books seriously disrupted the close friendship of the 4 Hs in this series as the deceased, Baron Lakewood, was also a friend.  The series is about not only the romances of each of the 4 men, but also about resolution of their friendship.As many reviewers have commented, it is difficult to like or even feel much sympathy for Lydia on a number of levels. She comes across as moody, bratty, selfish and spoiled. She acts in very irrational and at times stupid ways.  Her obsession with Lakewood's death seems unbelievable given the small number of encounters we learn the two actually had. Penthurst is too narrowly drawn a character and we don't get that sense that much emotion exists or else he keeps it so tightly tamped down, we never really get to know who he is really is.  He is clearly honorable, responsible etc. But who is he at his core? We never really find that out. Several of the characters from the other books in the series reappear, but they seem somehow a shadow of the characters they were in their own books.My slight dissatisfaction with this book is that it is not really a romance.  This book is about wrapping up the loose ends from the other books, revealing what a cad Lakewood really was, and Lydia's slow realization that Lakewood had only pretended to care for her and that her moping aboput was all in vain. The premise about what can flow from a single event--the duel--and the repercussions it can have long after provides food for thought and I think the author does a fine job with that. However, all the other books had more of a plot than this premise and the stories seemed more believable for it. This novel seemed to drag on for  a long time, dwelling on boring details that were not that interesting, to be honest. I also did not like the resolution of the two \"villains\" and the hurried explanation at the end.My biggest complaint, however, is there seemed to be nothing other than physical attraction between the H and the h for most of the book. Neither really liked the other at the outset, nor did either even admire or respect the other. As the story progressed, we did not see much interaction between them on an emotional rather than physical level.  It was a little hard to believe at the end that they really did believe they loved each other. It seemed a little forced and artificial: ok, I have wrapped up my story and now these two need a HEA, so tell each other you love the other.  I left  with the impression I was pretty sure that whatever attraction they felt for the other would very soon evaporate. There was just not enough build-up of their relationship for me to believe it would last very long. There was a hint or two that perhaps they had actually been attracted to each other in the past, but for various reasons ignored that attraction and never admitted it to themselves. If the author had done even a little bit more with that, I would have been a lot happier.This is the first Madeline Hunter book that ever left me feeling a little disappointed. It is by no means a bad book; in fact, in many respects it is good. Just not up to the author's general standards and the rest of this series.\n",

This is one of my most visual Birdhouse Books, recently purchased to sate' my desire to buy everything out there on bird houses. Some of these houses laid out in the book are quite basic, like a nesting box for ducks mounted on a pole and then there are several designs that are almost like works of art, detailed, painted like a newly built home and with details that rival the doll houses made for a favorite little girl.  These are not necessarily in the line of a natural approach, but they are attractive and well built.  Each house is shown as completed in a full page color picture of it, where the author has it mounted for use and display.  Feeders are also shown in finished built pictures of full of feed for the birds to enjoy.  If you are a visual person and like to page through these types of books this book is for you.  If you want plans, complete with material lists, size descriptions and bird specific layouts, this book may fall short of what you are looking for and other books may please you more, I wanted more for detail, thus I will continue to look for more, ever more to purchase, usually used, to have for my collection of building books, not just birdhouses, but almost everything out there.

            "This is certainly the most unusual historical romance I've read, and I feel it fair to warn readers not to be taken in by the cliched and seemingly benign cover. It is in many aspects confusing, but nothing in the story can be compared to the pandemonium that occurred in the end, which frankly, frightened me a bit. Not that the resolution with the villain was unexpected, mind you, but the manner in which this was done -- and it revealed a hidden ruthlessness to the heroine that I was shocked to discover.As there was never a year given in the story, I'm tempted to judge by all the \"modernisms\" in this story and put it in the Victorian rather than the Regency (though given the author's previous works, it is probably set in the Regency period). The confusing aspects are a result of several factors, one of which being that the story begin very much in medias res. The heroine attempted to avoid being trapped into another bargain with the villain, who had been using her brother's gambling debts as a means of keeping her indebted to her, to eventually get her into his bed. Then, we jump to the hero's perspective as he had always wanted to court the heroine but had been waiting until he obtains a caption's position in order to do so. But as the story progresses, he is suddenly given a dukedom and the heroine is no longer someone of his social equal. To compound the problem, the hero, heroine, and villain all knew each other while growing up. And thus a triangular relationship is established by which the story progresses in increments of machinations, vast confusion - not to mention disturbances by (somewhat) insane and otherwise troublesome relatives, least of all a very abrupt ending that leaves me unconvinced of the protagonists' romance factor.By now you may wonder if this novel is truly as atrocious as I describe it so. No, it is not, but unfortunately I was too confused and astounded by the bloodthirstiness and rather insane behavior/plans of some of the characters to appreciate much of this story. In all seriousness, I would feel better were this labeled historical fiction with suspense elements rather than historical romance.My final verdict: I have briefly described my opinion of this book which can be interpreted as a mildly or overtly disfavorable opinion.*Review copy received via Netgalley\n",

My wife had to stop reading because she said it was too much, which I think is a compliment of the author's bravery and unflinching portrayal of Mirielle's captivity. An indictment of the violence men do.Only thing that kept it from 5-stars for me was some infelicities in the prose and that it could perhaps be 20-25 pages shorter/tighter. It's admirably unshowy, as it should be, but there's some lines that clang in the ear for lack of care and attention. Most of the book is so strong that those slight bobbles stand out all the more.

It's not like that anymore.  I occasionally buy a book from the series, this was that occasion.  It's the same old story line with the same old predictable plot.  I bought this book in December of 2013 and just finished it (April 2014).  I became bored reading it so I stopped.  It doesn't grab you and hold you  until you finish reading it.  The last book I enjoyed was NY to Dallas, the few before that were so so, the ones after that are also so so.  I truly hope that Nora Roberts (JD Robb) steps up to the plate and gives this series a story line it deserves.  I know she's capable of it, but I think that she's publishing books so quickly and using ghost writers that this series is lacking in quality.

            "Quilters are artists.  I truly believe this.  Fabric sewn together, is not much different than paint on a canvas.  When I take on a project, I feel like I'm recreating an artist's designs similar to painting-by-number.  Each artist has their favorite medium and Cheryl Almgren Taylor's is clearly applique.  She has poured her heart into the eleven spectacular projects of this book as a presentation of faith, hope, and love, from a Christian perspective.  Using batik fabrics as paint and her sewing machine as brush; Cheryl paints a portrait of God's promises from the Bible.  Her imagery is inspirational.  I am confident that anyone who shares this belief would love and treasure these offerings.  I'm so happy that I purchased this book.  The photographs shown in the Look Inside feature sold me this book, however it's even better in person.Using the symbolism of the Bible, which Taylor explains in the introduction, she chose three passages from the Old Testament and eight from the New Testament.From Genesis 2:9, \"The Tree of Life\" is characterized on a pillow cover; Joshua 24:15, a much beloved verse, comes to life in the wall hanging, \"As For Me and My House;\" and another wall hanging, \"We Are His Sheep,\" illuminates God's viewpoint that He is the Shepherd and we, His people, are the sheep in His pasture, from Psalm 100.The designs representing the New Testament:  \"Fishers of Men,\" reflects Jesus' promise in Matthew 4:19; \"Daily Bread\" a familiar concept from The Lord's Prayer, (Matthew 6:11) is featured in two projects; our value to God, (Matthew 6:26) is portrayed in  \"Birds of the Air;\" God's reminder that we should not worry, (Luke 12:27-28) is depicted in \"Lilies of the Field;\" The Bible's instruction of remaining in Christ so we would bear fruit, (John 15:5) is shown in \"I Am the Vine;\" (Galatians 5:22-23) is displayed in \"Fruits of the Spirit;\" and finally, \"Faith, Hope, and Love\" beautifully illustrates 1 Corinthians 13:13.To accomplish her \"paintings,\" Cheryl chooses fusible web applique.  There are comprehensive instructions for using fusible web.  The templates are full-sized.  At the back of the book is \"Quilt Making Basics,\" which covers Taylor's recommendations on fabrics, tools & supplies, rotary cutting, adding borders, and binding.  There isn't instruction given for quilting, but we can see the quilting in the lovely photographs of the finished products.I also liked,Deck the Halls: Quilts to Celebrate Christmasby Cheryl Almgren Taylor.\n",

From there, Timbuktu is a four day trip by bus and boat on and along the Niger River, all the time traveling eastward and deeper into what we used to call \"the Heart of Darkest Africa!\"  Even a seasoned traveler would think twice and the author is a middle-aged guy who has scarcely ever been outside of his native Scotland. All he knew about Timbuktu is that his mother used to threaten to send him there when he misbehaved.For reasons which he's still unable to explain, he jokingly told his wife that she could buy him a ticket there for his 60th birthday  and she took him at his word.  The die was cast, even though he first had to go to Dakar, Senegal to get a visa.  He traveled to Timbuktu on the buses and boats used by the locals.  When he arrived he found a town which was much reduced from it's glory days as the center of the north African caravan routes.  The desert has taken over parts of the town and there is the looming presence of camps of Tuaregs - Islamic Bedouins  who controlled the area before the French took over in the 19th century.  Ironically, Tuareg rebels captured the town in April 2012 and held it for almost a year before it was re-taken by French and Malian forces. Today the area is not considered safe for travel.The writing is sometimes rough, but the author is likable and honest and it's just a great story!\n",

I mean HOLY HELL I started reading this book and my heart went out to all three of the alpha males in this story.On a very snowy day Kieth and Reed are sitting at home spending time together when they spot something out of the ordinary. When they go to look to see what it is they spot a guy. Not sure who he is Kieth is suspicious of him but something in Reed is saying there is something wrong with the guy for him to be out in the middle of a snow storm.Reed decides he and Kieth need to nurse him back to health but Kieth is reluctant until Reed tells him it is okay to open up and trust him. Shane wakes up and realizes he is in a different place and he is not sure who he is and why he there but he does know he is in danger and he has to put the pieces together in order to find out what is going on with him.As Shane tries to uncover his life he and Reed and Kieth begin to develop a friendship and Reed has even started to have feelings for him. But Kieth is weary of him and wants to keep his distance. That is easier said then done because when Shane is in danger the guys come to his rescue and realize that they need to protect him and put their differences aside.Will Kieth put his feelings out there and give in to the feelings he has for Shane or will he turn his back on him and let him figure things out on his own?\n",

One day, a friend shared a story of her friend's daughter who had cancer. I chose not to look away, as too many do. What I watched over the next 4 years was heartwrenching and terrifying for any mother to even think of, let alone experience. I became determined to find a way to help, and got involved with many cancer families, and I have watched so many families struggle to cope with the death of their beautiful children..I've seen parents living in fear of the day they are told the monster is back..I've seen children nearly die from the side effects of their cancer treatments, and I've seen children DIE from the side effects. I know that the heartache I felt for them was not even a pinch of the pain they felt and feel today. I have worked for years with special needs adults and children..and while it is a hard road it is not an impossible one. Impossible is when you are told there is nothing left that can be done, impossible is watching your child die a slow, agonizing death. Cancer is nothing to say you wish your child had whether you mean it in a different way or not. This author should have thought twice about the families who have really been through cancer and are going through it. It's offensive and this is the worst title I've seen for a book.. Maybe your life is hard, but so many others have it harder. And you didn't need such an offensive title. Autism will not ravage your child's body the way Cancer does, and it certainly won't take their life.To mothers with children who have fought or are fighting cancer, I am so sorry this book exists.. To mother's who have lost their child, I am sorry for your loss.This book should simply be removed..\n",

            "If you&#8217;ve landed on this page, you probably already know that Tony Hillerman was a mystery writer best known for his stories in and around the Navajo Indian Reservation. The central figure, Joe Leaphorn, works for the Navajo Tribal Police &#8211; though he has decided to retire at the start of this book. Leaphorn&#8217;s investigation intersects with that of Jim Chee, who has his own concerns and a different, more traditional approach to the Navajo culture than does Leaphorn.Like Hillerman&#8217;s other books, this one has a strong sense of place. Beat-up dirt roads, back-of-nowhere places lying down forgotten tracks, a desert landscape and possibility of rain all mark the book.Hillerman&#8217;s series also relies on clashes of culture &#8211; most obviously that between whites and Navajos, but also differences in worldview between Leaphorn and Chee. Status differences in the white world also play an important role in how characters behave. Some characters understand one another and respect cultural differences; others don&#8217;t. Sadly, many of the people who don&#8217;t respect others are anthropologists and archaeologists.  As in many of Hillerman&#8217;s mysteries, you can see some reasons here why Native Americans tend to dislike these professions.The story moves well, but the mystery was unsatisfying &#8211; I didn&#8217;t find the culprit well-drawn or the crime well-motivated. However, the real point of the book is the journey across a landscape, not a clever mystery puzzle.\n",

Set in the late &#8216;80s Glowing Embers revolves around the lives of two girls; Pashen and Valentina.  For most, starting your freshman year in high school is a joyous occasion but for Pashen and Valentina it marks the turmoil both of their lives encounter.Pashen was an only child, she was the apple of her mother&#8217;s eye and likewise she loved her mother with all her being.  Alma however was lonely and begins to relate with Bill.  After marrying Bill, Pashen&#8217;s life changes.  Bill is unlike Alma and Pashen, he is unlearned and abusive.  His growing disdain for Pashen and intellect reflects in his treatment of Alma.  Pashen endures the months to years of turmoil stemming from neglect and seeing her mother belittled and abused; mentally and physically.Valentina is the youngest daughter born to her family.  She is the delight of her parents.  However her life takes a turn for the worst, when her mother decides the life she wants is not the one she is living.  Valentina is an old soul, even in the midst of chaos she is the strength that propels her family forward.Through the bonds of friendship and sisterhood, Pashen and Valentina triumph against the elements of hatred, jealousy and the many obstacles life threw at them.  Their unity survived the fire.  Glowing Embers in a Dying Fire is a nostalgic tale of friendship and strength.  At the end of the day, it reminds us of the most precious thing in life.  LOVE.\n",

Typically, I don&#8217;t pick up something this short (even if it&#8217;s free), but I was in the mood for a time-travel romance.  My rating takes the length into account, for I would drop a star (plus) if the same weaknesses kept going for a full-length novel.But first the strengths: I thought the author did a great job with Rose's confusion and struggle/inability to cope with life in the 13th century. I know I certainly couldn&#8217;t sew a decent hem to save my life. It was good to see the imperfections and not an I-can-do-anything heroine. Also, the external goals/plot was clearly explained (Rose's need to get back to her time and Julien's need to &#8220;graduate&#8221; from under this mentor in order to strike out on his own). How that was going to be accomplished moved the quick story forward.However, I missed some items from the story that I wish would have been included. No steps towards love. Just some mild lusting-my-you&#8217;re-attractive for most of the story and then to undying love with no real reason &#8211; no external circumstance or internal decision. What this really comes down to is &#8220;the why&#8221; or their motivation.  How does the one fulfill an internal need for the other that no one else has done in the past? It was very muddled. I realize it is hard to accomplish that task in a novella to a satisfying depth, but I missed it nonetheless.That said, I would recommend the story if you are looking for a quick poolside read or the like, and I would consider other stories by the author.  As a matter of full disclosure, I received my Kindle version free from Story Cartel [dot] com in exchange for a balanced and honest review.\n",

            "This talented author&#8217;s love of Alaska shines through as she tells the world of its past.In this, the first book in the series, the author takes her readers right back in time, to when the first Alaska Natives arrived, there after crossing the Bering Sea Land Bridge,  thousands of years ago, and through history until the famous Klondike Gold Rush in the nineteenth century.She does this wonderfully, bringing the history of this amazing place to life, through short stories, which vary tremendously. Through her brilliant penmanship, she brings alive the lives of these people who made this made this land their own under incredibly harsh conditions.For me, though, I have to say the wonderful collection of hundreds of pictures were the icing on this most enjoyable cake. Being able to actually SEE the people who were alive in those times past is a joy I will never tire of, and it enhanced even more (if possible) my enjoyment of these wonderful tales.I have never been to Alaska, however I would love to do so, especially having read this book.\n",

            "As in the other books, we meet some new characters this time and get to know others a lot better.  This book focuses on Genevieve, a brilliant and slightly nerdy MIT student, and Chad, a somewhat broken vampire.  Genevieve really blossoms in this story, but even her growth doesn't make her lose the most endearing part of her... her social awkwardness that makes her so cute.  I like that Chad wasn't created to be vampire perfection.  Instead, he had doubts and he was, at least in his own eyes, broken.  It was a great twist to the standard YA romantic hero.Fans of  Maggie and Shane are going to be disappointed because there is little of them in this book.  But the story is growing and it is obvious that they will be back.  I like this way of building the story, getting different perspectives in different books by focusing on different characters.  There is a lot of action and a whole lot of mystery and intrigue building and building.  I can't wait to see where it goes next!Things to love...--Genevieve.  I like that she finds her own strengths and starts to appreciate herself.--Anticipation.  The story is building to a climax, adding layers with each book!Things I wanted more/less of...--Chloe, Maggie, and Shane.  These three are fan favorites and even though they aren't the center of the story right now, I wish there had been a little more of them.Some Quotastic Goodness--My chest is so tight, it hurts.  I pant, trying to keep quiet when I want to gasp.  I wish I had a paper bag, but my captors have taken everything from me- most importantly, my freedom (Loc. 37).--And holding her against me as we hung off the side of that train... I felt something (Loc. 751).--It's a ton of pressure on her, putting the lives of so many humans, and our group in particular, on Genevieve.  But she hasn't complained once.  She's a fighter, she just fights with a unique set of tools, the best of  which is her exquisite mind (Loc. 1793).My Recommendation:  This is a great series.  Vamps and mystery and romance... what more could you want?!  Next up is Delicate Accord, due out in the summer of 2014.  This will be Lily and Caleb's story.This review originally appeared on my blog, [...]\n",

            "If you haven't already read the previous books of this series, you might want to since these stories are forever entwining. I love how this author can take a character who sees themself as insignificant, and definately NOT what they were destined to be, and turn them into something from legend where everyone knows without a doubt who they are. Every detail can be significant. In this story, Lionheart's cousin, Foxbrush, is at a place where he is about to assume the throne of the Eldest and marry the lady he's always loved. Problem is, Foxbrush is so far from being ready it's unreal. He struggles with seeing himself as someone who could be respected. He's terrified of crowds and prefers books to people. When his bride-to-be, Daylily,runs off before the wedding, he decides to step out of his comfort zone and go after her, if only to tell her he loves her enough to let her go if that's really what she wants. Meanwhile Daylily is on a mission to finally be free of obligations and once and for all destroy all the fierceness of her true self. These two must become all they were meant to be, before it's too late and what they know of their past and future becomes destroyed. Don't worry, this story still has all the fairies, knights of farthest shore, and power hungry nobles we know and love:) Altogether a mix that captures you from start to finish! Happy reading:)\n",

It's not in your face, it's not a secret that is finally dumped on you, it's a slow unraveling, with enough clues to make you piece things together.And once you put two and two together, your still surprised by an added revelation.  Wonderful writing, wonderful execution.The characters were well-developed, and the interactions were tight and pithy.  The friends were supportive without being necessarily smarter than the protagonists, and the families could actually exist.  Avery's parents didn't feel like caricatures as can some times happen when portraying those type of personalities.Terrific job keeping me involved in the story and taking me on Cam and Avery's journey.

I just couldn't wait to read about their journey and hoping they could let each other In.Bronagh is a strong willed woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind and use her words and or hands when needed.Dominic is an intense, Dominating, loving, beast. He has a temper and is ruthless.Branna is Bronagh's sister who took over as guardian when Their parents died. Family is first and she just wants to see her sister happy.I really enjoyed the story of Dominic and Bree and fell in love with their characters and felt a strong connection to them.At times I was shocked and like WTH when Dominic and Bree were having their fits. I couldn't believe what he would say and call her. Their banter back and forth at times were funny and at times emotional.I felt such an emotional connection with Bree, when she was hurt and felt alone I was getting teary eyed and felt for her. Then I was happy when she finally gave Dom another chance and they both let their guard down a little and let each other in.L.A brings us on an emotional roller coaster and on Bree's journey from shutting people out after her parents died to letting love in. Dominic's journey is always having to be strong and helping his family out and to deciding to put himself and his feelings first when he can't get a certain someone out of his mind.&#34;You've always been mine, pretty girl.

This part of the saga accounts for the 1000 years after the crucifixion of Jesus/Tribunal and his plan to overthrow God, with Nyx at his side. But even to a god (or goddess), a lot can happen in a thousand years. Even the best laid plans will or will not bear fruit.I really liked the book, but some may not care for the graphic nature. Just because you see God and Angels, Heaven and Hell does not imply a Sunday School lesson. The Holy Bible it is not. It is a pretty fast and easy read with quite a bit of action to it.

I have been looking forward to this happily-ever-after book for a very long time and once I had it in my hands I finished it in one sitting. ONE!! It was that addictive. I was taken on an emotional journey of life, loss, hurt and beautiful redemption. A Blue Tale has a totally different vibe than her debut duet, Haven from the Storm (Storms of Life #1) and Before the Storm (Storms of Life Series) , but it is equally addictive!Sarah has a way of making you feel pain where you really didn't think was possible. Taking a risk with this book, Sarah stepped away from everything that was comfortable and wrote a beautifully tragic love story. She broke me down, only to build me back up with an amazing ending.A musician with a dark and twisty past, a beautiful woman who's grown up in the shadows of her father's rock star life...when their lives collide for a second time, there's no turning back for either one.

Inferno continues Dan Brown's portrayal of Professor Robert Langdon who uses his unique skills in code breaking and knowledge of history and art, to solve current problems involving the Catholic Church.Now, I may be off when I say his writings all deal with the Catholic Church. I should say, the three Robert Langdon books I have read were rooted in Catholicism, the Vatican, etc. In this book, Brown does a great job of weaving Dante's Inferno into modern times. Without giving away the plot, Langdon gets involved in a plot to &#34;bring Dante's vision of hell to Earth&#34;.The writing is great, the plot is well put together. However, the premise for the plot is contrived and a bit of a stretch. Here, Brown's politics come through and, while I may agree with the politics behind it, I'm not sure all of his readers feel the same way. This is the reason for three stars rather than four.\n",

Doherty certainly has a way with heroic fiction. Have not read a better series than this since David Gemmell passed. Since this is historical fiction also, there is no comparing his work with Tolkien, Martin, Sanderson, or Michael Sullivan. But if he did fantasy I would expect it to be top tier also. Now onward to the East. If #3 is as good as 1 & 2 I will finish by tomorrow. He certainly makes you feel as if you were there. A couple extra turnabouts on this one. More mystery also....shu\n",

            "With so much action going on and so many perspectives to tell the story from, &#34;Black Hawk Down&#34; give a truly in-depth look at what happened over the course of less than a day, but just like the fog of war confuses those within it, the mashing of multiple story lines challenges the reader to do lots of work on keeping up with who is where and doing what. This gets easier as the book moves along because the names and locations become more familiar, but to truly understand the first half of the book, one must read it again with the accumulated knowledge of having read the entire book. Other than that, it was written so that the non-military mind can understand the various situations with limited knowledge of tactical jargon and that's a good thing for those of us who do not have a military background but enjoy reading books about the history of our military to get a better appreciation at what they do to provide security for Americans and allies alike.\n",

Since Night of the Owls and Death of the Family are happening around this volume, it only gets a few real chances to tell its own story. That said, I loved the direction. Vol 1 was all about Bruce and Damian as father and son, but this highlights Damian and the former Robins as brothers. It's really fun to see Damian make his points and defend his right to hold the mantle. If anyone thought he had something to prove, this is where he proves it. Great story, I just wish it wasn't so rushed.\n",

Unfortunately, even though they received a huge payout, their willful ignorance of business once they entered the big leagues resulted in their losing control of their business and brand, which then resulted in the virtual erasure of it. The brand lingers on today as a parody of its former self. Sadly too, their employees (whom they praised effusively) never got partake in the windfall either (or at least it was never stated in the book.) This book is a classic example of the &#34;proud of being ignorant&#34; mantra, which is as old as time.

Every edition is a winner, featuring recipes that are so layered in complexity of flavors, it's hard to believe they can be prepared in under an hour, let alone, thirty minutes. Soup's On is jam-packed with more than 100 quick and easy recipes that will delight every palate. And we're not talking appetizer soups here. We're talking show-stopping dishes that are so nourishing, filling, and satisfying, you'll never think of soup as merely the prelude to an entr&eacute;e again.Along with a scrumptious variety of soups and stews, you'll find lots of delicious extras&#8212;from Herbed Bread Sticks to Red Pepper Coulis, Soup's On elevates the art of vegan soup-making to new culinary heights. While every soup and stew within the pages of this book stands on its own, each recipe comes with suggested variations, as well as the perfect accompaniments, so you won't have to guess how to put together an absolutely fabulous meal. Just a few of the recipes I have already made from Soup's on include Mark's sweet and spicy Brazilian Black Bean Soup with Baked Plantain. Black beans make this sumptuous Latin treat nutritious and hearty. Maple-baked plantain and a bit of freshly squeezed orange juice add a touch of sweetness, and jalape&ntilde;o and chipotle pepper add a zesty bite. Raw Cashew Cr&egrave;me frache counterbalances the heat, and Candied Pepitas add another lovely touch of sweetness and a bit of crunch.Mark's Asian-inspired Hot Pot with Soba Noodles, Seared Shiitake Mushrooms and Baby Bok Choy is a heavenly choice on a cold, wet, winter day. Broken down into three simple-to-prepare recipes for Baked Tofu, Seared Shiitake and Baby Bok Choy, and a savory noodle-and-vegetable-infused broth, you'll love how this dish comes together so easily. With clear and concise instructions, it's a breeze to flow from one step to the next, tackling more than one task at a time. While the noodles and broth are cooking, it's time to prepare the shiitake and bok choy.If you love the sweet, smoky flavor of BBQ, then the recipe for down-home BBQ Tempeh and Roasted Corn Stew will satisfy your taste buds. I served it with Cosmic Double Corn Bread and topped it with toasted pepitas, but it would have been a complete meal all on its own. Mark's soul-satisfying Roasted Root Vegetable Soup is loaded with onions, carrots, fennel, parsnips, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes (I used yams).

What a beautiful presentation, don't you think?If you love the sweet, smoky flavor of BBQ, then this delectable down-home BBQ Tempeh and Roasted Corn Stew is right up your alley. I served it with Cosmic Double Corn Bread and topped it with toasted pepitas. Until toasting pepitas (aka pumpkin seeds), I hadn't realized I enjoyed them so much. Pumpkin seeds are a great source of vitamin E, protein, iron, magnesium, and zinc. And toasting them for less than 20 minutes ensures that they're cooked under the threshold for unwanted changes to the seeds' healthy fats.With another wave of Arctic cold air whipping through this week and anticipated temperatures dipping down into the teens, I will surely be making this soul-satisfying Roasted Root Vegetable Soup again. Loaded with onions, carrots, fennel, parsnips, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes (I used yams), it's seasoned to perfection with just the right blend of herbs and balsamic. Topped with Tofu Feta, it's a Mediterranean feast in a bowl!I could go on and on about all of the recipes I've made from Soup's On so far, each one a delightful surprise, more delicious than the last. The 30 Minute Vegan Soup's On will have you turning out tasty, filling, and hearty bowls of goodness in less time than it takes to order takeout. And your meals will be so much more delicious, nutritious, and satisfying than anything you'll find on a takeout menu. While we're still in the midst of winter's cold embrace, get your hands on a copy of this wonderful book. The recipe for Seared Shiitake and Baby Bok Choy alone, is worth the modest cover price. And if you enjoy slurping soup in the warmer months, you'll be covered, because there are lots of spring and summer soup recipes in Soup's On, too!\n",

            "There is so much emphasis on the heroine's plainness, that it is hard to imagine a handsome man falling in love with her. Still, her loving ways and willingness to do what is needed no matter how lowly, makes her a lovely woman. It is easy to understand why Miss Ellie would marry Jackson on such short notice considering her horrible circumstances. It is all so easy to understand why Jackson would choose a loveless marriage with a plain woman based on his past love and his dead wife. His boys need a mother. He needs....well, he doesn't know what he needs because of the anger in his heart. Slowly her love for his boys and her quiet spiritual strength and her handling of difficult situations brings Jackson to the realization that he has found what real love is.\n",

            "The third book in the Rogue Hunter series really throws us for some loops. I was caught a little off guard with how much of the story was focused on her sex life. I would go so far as to saying it's a little risque crossing into the erotica zone in several scenes. A little more descriptive scenes than I would normally read.This series amazing, the world building and characters are so well done that I just cannot get enough of this series. Zyra has a lot of ups and downs in this story. She gets sick and falls in love. Along with this whirlwind romance comes a lot of vulnerability from Zyra. I even felt that we lose a bit of the Zyra we have grown to know and see her having to crawl her way out of an emotional hole that has taken a toll on her.Zyra still shows her bad ass side with not only being sick, in a roller coaster relationship, but also being hunted by hired killers. Several plot twists and harsh situations that come along with both. She still manages to find her way through things with a lot of action, and heartbreak.The writing is spot on when it comes to getting the readers emotionally invested in the story. There were times I was so upset that I had to stop reading for awhile and I really felt for the relationships, both good and bad that occur in this book.I recommend this series 100% as a very well written, plotted, and high paced space opera. It's a series that I have added to my automatic to-buy list because I know each new edition will be an amazing, entertaining and enjoyable read.\n",

            "The thing about Mind Games is that I was terribly detached to all the characters right from the start. If I made any connection with any of the characters, it would have to be James. He actually had a compelling &#34;backstory,&#34; and he actually had normal, human feelings, unlike Fia and Annie. For one, Fia really doesn't have a personality. Or if she does, it just describes her as one word&#8212;crazy. She's legitimately crazy. And her sister Annie isn't much better. Annie might not be crazy, but I'm certainly not crazy about her.Right off the bat this book caught my attention, but within 20 pages, it lost it. I thought Adam was going to be an interesting character to read about, but he wasn't present for the majority of the novel. The idea of Fia being trained from a young age to assassinate people and then choose not to assassinate a geeky teenage boy over a dog is ludicrous. (Fia sees Adam petting a dog on the side of the street, and she decides to not kill him. Like what?)Enough about the characters. The world-building/writing is a whole other matter. For one, as a reader you're thrown into the plot unexpectedly. At first, that worked toward the book's advantage, instantly showing the reader action. But as the book went along, the lack of world-building really irritated me. I never really knew what was going on. I picked up on certain aspects of the novel, but it took the entire 237 pages to figure out the majority of the plot. And it took me a good 30-50 pages to figure out that Annie was blind.Also, the writing was enough to get me to groan. Fia did things three times. Three. Freaking. Times. She tap, tap, tapped and pop, pop, popped. Yeah, well, she drove, drove, drove me insane. OH, YES. And Annie had NO REGARD for her sister whatsoever. Annie was always talking/thinking about how she loved her sister, but she didn't really show it. In my mind, Annie was holding Fia back unknowingly.I really don't know what to say about this book, because there really isn't much to say. After 50%, the plot got really slow and somewhat meaningless. I felt like it was a gigantic prologue, especially with the constant flashbacks. I would've been semi-okay with the flashbacks if they actually moved the plot along, but the thing is, the flashbacks did nothing for the novel, which once again lowered my rating for the book.Despite my two star rating, I didn't dislike this book, but I didn't like it either. I don't really have any strong feelings toward it (okay, maybe strong feelings toward snapping Fia's fingers off if she tap, tap, taps them one more time, but that's beside the point); I'm pretty neutral about the whole book. I won an ARC for Perfect Lies, so I'll be reading the next book, but it's not high on my TBR. I wouldn't really recommend this book unless you're looking for a quick read and don't mind not feeling anything for the characters/plot/world-building.\n",

            "Hello &#8211; Robin from Hesperia Loves Books, here. Last night, I finished reading what may be one of my favorite novels, ever &#8211; Maybe Someday by Colleen Hoover. This novel has been on my radar for months. I had spoken with friends who were fortunate enough to read advanced reader copies at the beginning of February, so I knew this story was going to be special. It was unprecedented. Colleen Hoover&#8217;s best work yet. The music awesome. The story is powerful.Ridge Lawson is a musician with writer&#8217;s block. Sydney Blake lives in apartment located across the courtyard of his apartment complex. She listens to Ridge play guitar in the evenings and has no trouble coming up with her own lyrics to his music. Ridge realizes this, so he asks Sydney to assist him with writing several new songs for his band. The story is told from an alternating first-person point of view.Maybe Someday is not just a novel &#8211; it is an experience. This project is a collaboration between American Idol star, Griffin Peterson, and novelist, Colleen Hoover. Griffin wrote an original soundtrack for the novel, and the lyrics of his songs are used in the novel. Readers will find a link to each of the songs of the soundtrack in the novel and will be able to listen to the songs being performed while reading the lyrics.Slow-build romances are truly my weakness. Colleen Hoover wrote the perfect novel for me. Have you ever read a novel where the characters make love to each other without truly making love? Ridge and Sydney do this. They share so much respect, tenderness and affection for each other. Thank you for your beautiful words, Colleen. I am completely over the moon. Maybe Someday is one story I will never forget.\n",

I would have liked to have seen a few line drawings of ships types mentioned, such sloop, cutter, brig and snow in a center or appendix section. Also a good map of the islands, southern Italy, Greece and Turkey to better follow the action. As one who has spent years in the area, knowing Greek and fair Turkish, the plot twists involving these regions and people were an added attraction and give an insight to a little known theater of the Napoleanic Wars. A very enjoyable book with (thankfully) a PG rating unlike another otherwise excellent nautical series. Highly recommend reading it, and ask author to add maps in the next edition. A yar read!\n",

            "Widowed with 2 sons to care for, Lena has taken on the heavy work of farming in the late 1800's. For three years she has managed to do a &#34;man's&#34; work as well as her motherly duties. She's received marriage proposals from local farmers, but while they might be able to relieve her of the farm work, they are not the men of character she wants for her husband and the father of her boys. It occurs to her that widowed men in her position often advertise back east for a wife, and she decides to try the same seeking a husband. The man is chosen from those who responded and she waits in eager anticipation for him to arrive. But Gabriel is not at all the man she expected him to be; he,s fat, clumsy, socially awkward, totally  inexperienced at farming, and, due to the fact that he prefers to read rather than be around people, he uses a lot of big words that make him difficult to understand. It's not love at first for Gabriel, either. He had expected that a woman who had to advertise for a husband must be pretty plain to look at, but Lena is attractive. Gabriel has had nothing but hurt and rejection from attractive women, including his mother. He believes no attractive woman would remain faithful for long and that she would belittle him. He had wanted a stable home like he had never known before and now it seems that dream was in jeopardy. But both of them wanted God's will to be done in their lives and had committed to this union feeling it was what He was providing. Can it work? Is there any hope for the loving home they both want? This is a very nicely written book, and DiAnn Mills deserves credit for writing something unique in modern romances--the introduction of a male love interest with less than the normally required 6-pack abs. A truly heartwarming story.\n",

            "Let me preface this review by saying I have read and enjoyed every book Grisham has written. Generally he is quite entertaining and the reader usually doesn't know what's coming at the end. Sadly, this book isn't up to the same quality of his other legal fiction.He starts with the suicide of a wealthy man who has just  written (as in ink on paper) a new will. The term holographic will should not be strange to any Grisham fan, as his earlier book, The Testament, begins the same way.I will try not to give away anything we learn at the end, although I will say i figured it out very early in this slow reading book. We do learn early on that there is an earlier will, prepared by some hotshot lawyers at a big out of town law firm. It leaves his assets to his kids and grandkids and uses the full extent of legal mumbo jumbo, tax planning and other legerdemain  to minimize the estate taxes due upon one's death. All well and good--the guy was smart, made a lot of money, and didn't want the taxman to get his mitts into his pile of cash. I liked the guy.So, if you have slogged through this book to the end, I'll ask you some simple questions:1. If you wanted to take care of someone, would you wait YEARS until you are literally dead before you did ANYTHING to help that person? There are a lot of ways to transfer assets/cash, with minimal tax consequences.2. If you wanted to leave someone your estate after death, why would you create a freakin' prior will and then hire Jake Brigance to fight the other beneficiaries because you never revoked that earlier will while alive? It would be INSANE to do this. If you hated your family, and Seth makes it clear he did, why ever sit down and create such a document? Even if you changed your mind after creating the first will, send the big shot law firm a notarized (or whatever) letter that simply says I revoke my will of such and such a date, signed Seth Hubbard. Have a nice day! Or go to their office in the flesh, whatever--it is your money and the lawyers are simply carrying out your wishes. You have the right to change your mind. Ask for the original out of their vault (yes there is a will vault) and tear it up with witnesses present. The ultimate revocation!3. Then, have that same hotshot law firm, using the same tax minimizing tricks, create a new will that leaves the money to your beneficiary of choice, again minimizing what the taxman collects, using generation skipping trusts, etc.. This is what a smart businessman like Seth Hubbard would have done.4. Even if you developed memory problems and had forgotten the address of the bigshot law firm, if you knew you were going to kill yourself and that there was definitely going to be a contest over the prior will (see above), why not go to a real lawyer, revoke the prior will and make another one? On the first few pages, we learn that Seth hated lawyers but liked Jake (by reputation). So get down to the Square in Clanton, have Jake make you a new will, which revokes the earlier one and creates new beneficiaries, and THEN go kill yourself.Finally, there are mysteries here, as to the WHY. Without revealing the who, what, when,... we do find out the answers toward the end. Seth does literally nothing to explain things to anyone before he dies, nor does he leave behind any documents that would explain why he did what he did. This is the same guy who buys a grave plot, arranges things with the undertaker, plans who will sing which hymn at his service and names his pallbearers. But he doesn't give any reason for why he leaves his fortune to his housekeeper. It remains for a third party to provide the explanation. Seth has a very valid reason--why on earth would he take that to the grave, knowing that it may remain a mystery for all time? For a guy we keep hearing about was really sharp and knew what he was doing, I really have my doubts.\n",

            "This was my first read by this author but it will definitely NOT be my last. The book got off to a really &#34;busy&#34; start. There were lots of characters and then the author did an excellent job of alternating back and forth between the character's real names and their chat line handles. This further added to my confusion.Toward the middle of the book, the plot thickened so much that I got used to the characters and even when I wasn't 100% sure who was with who half the time, the story got so good that it didn't matter. I actually would have enjoyed seeing this story as a movie. The authors painted such clear images in my mind that I felt as if I was watching it as opposed to reading.As I read the book, I wondered how would HOOD bring everything together. Well, he did NOT disappoint me. I hate to read spoilers in reviews so I won't give anything away. I will say that this is an excellent read and I can appreciate the thought and attention to details the writer put into the book. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because there were so many characters and so many names and I had to keep double-checking myself and that slowed me down a bit. This book was entertaining, original and kept me on edge.I'll be reading the next book in the Black Love series soon.\n",

I had read a lot about the Civil War before this but never about the prisons and this book was very detailed and much of the detail came from actual diaries left by men who had been at the prison.  The inhumane conditions at Andersonville prison in  Georgia caused the deaths of over 13,000 Union soldiers in a little over a year.  The people in the nearby town knew what was going on and this is the story of what some of them tried to do to make things better.

            "Before I get into the details about why I LOVED this book and the trilogy as a whole, I need to put out a disclaimer: Under The Never Sky is a character heavy trilogy. It relies solely on the personalities, developments and actions of its characters. Just like many dystopias out there, it sets up a world for you but it does NOT extend beyond that. Do we know how the aethers came to be? No. Do we know how and why the PODS were set up? No. Why were the people separated to begin with? None of that becomes a focus. If you are looking for extensive world building and answers in regards to this dark, deadly, electrical storm ravaged world &#8211; this book is NOT for you.If you are looking for an array of interesting characters, leads worthy of rooting for, romance that never, ever, ever overshadows the plot, strong friendships, disturbing villains and a constant sense of danger, this trilogy IS most definitely for you.With all that said, Into the Still Blue left me completely satisfied. Coming from me, it&#8217;s a great compliment. To be fair, it wasn&#8217;t the most exciting book (Through The Ever Night remains the strongest in the bunch) but it did what it was supposed to do &#8211; conclude the story in the way that made sense to the text. Rossi never loses focus. Her writing is smooth, clear and descriptive enough. No purple prose here.  In the current, oversaturated market of trilogies, too many authors attempt to stray in order to be &#8220;edgy&#8221; (looking at you Veronica Roth and that pile of garbage you call books.) What usually happens is plot convulsion, deus ex machine resolutions, character regressions that make you wish you never started the trilogy to begin with.One of the main reasons I loved Into the Still Blue is Aria. Aria is the shiny, bright star for me. The kind of heroine girls and boys can look up to. While her personality is not the most unique (she doesn&#8217;t really jump off page,) it&#8217;s her intellect, persistence, abilities (mental & physical) that make me love her so much. Aria is fiercely independent, capable and strong. In this book, she demonstrates incredible amount of growth. From a scared, prejudiced and spoiled girl, she evolves into a capable young woman that others grow to love and respect. With so many people depending on her, she looks at the bigger picture and not once does she demonstrate selfishness or assert herself as a victim while others are suffering.Perry gets darker this time around. He has lost so many people in his life and has become immune to the concept of loss. It creates a rift between him and people he cares for but this is where relationship with Aria comes in place. She encourages him, gives him support when he needs it, doesn't judge him and lets him figure few things on his own. Aria and Perry have the kind of romance many of us can dream of. Aside from physical aspects... (Their physical chemistry still burns quite hot) it&#8217;s the bond between them that makes their romance sweet and poignant. The best part? Their love never defines them. It&#8217;s never the focus of the story and it never overshadows the plot. Both Aria and Perry rise above just being love interests to each other and become lovers, friends and partners in crime. They treat each other as equals. Love is supposed to exalt and dignify you&#8230;and that&#8217;s what Perry and Aria have in each other: someone you can lean your shoulder on when necessary and someone who believes in you.Aside from LIKEABLE, strong leads, Into the Still Blue utilizes its supporting and side characters very well. They are not plot devices used to compel the story but rather people, like Perry and Aria, who just want to see the next day. Soren, for example, goes from just a douchey bully, to a funny, conflicted character with his own set of problems. Roar goes through a period of severe depression because of Liv but his loyalty & friendship to Aria and Perry always remains the focus. I always feared the dreaded love triangle between Roar Aria and Perry, but Rossi is not about manipulating her readers with cheap tricks and tropes.Another reason why I enjoyed this book? No cardboard villains. They ALL have motivations, beliefs and reasons behind their actions. Sable is delusional, power hungry and manipulative. In his heart, he truly believes what he does is for the good and he is excellent at inducing fear into his subjects that takes form of false loyalty.SPOILER: In the end, when they finally reach the Still Blue, his control & division of people in order to establish a new society felt terrifying. His attempts to manipulate Aria with promises of brighter future while justifying murder and bloodshed made me feel uneasy. END SPOILER.The ending wasn't spectacular, I&#8217;ll admit to it. I wasn't blown away. It didn't have any shocking twists or revelations and I saw more than few things coming, but I still felt happy and satisfied with it. It was a journey that came to an end&#8230;and the Still Blue itself is a story for another time.\n",

If you like a sad/happy stories, ones, that bring on an emotion deep and profound and makes you really truly think about your life and those you love around you then this is the book for you.I did not know a lot about this book. I try hard not to know what i'm reading before I read it so that I am not biased one way or the other. But I didn't think it would be an entire book of deep emotion. I didn't know it would be about a girl having to decide whether she should pass on or stay in this world.I listened to this book on audio today. Not only is the story fully charged with a sense of loss and love and joy, but it has a great sense of stillness as well. The narrator did an amazing job of giving voice to Mia. When she was breaking down while reading the story I too broke down. There was a lot of trembling lips and blurry eyes through out this book. As a mom to an 8 and 6 year old, I would lose my s*** if anything happened to them. As a sister, I would lose my s*** if anything happened to my siblings. As you age, you get a sense of nearing the edge. You are still on that cliff face but one strong wind will blow you over and you don't know when the storm will come. Love the ones you are with. It could be any moment and poof they are gone. You could be the one that leaves and your loved ones will be left behind. Give thanks to friends and family.

While most concentrate on regular everyday people or retired soldiers or even ex Spec Ops, this one actually takes us to the heart of war. In this case in Afghanistan where a small group of soldiers on patrol find themselves cut off from their FOB Bremmel, they've lost more than half of their group and are on the run from an enemy they have no intel on. They make a run for Hairatan hoping to find answers and more importantly a safe place to get away from the large groups of 'Crazies' that have already decimated their group. Unfortunately Hairatan is also under siege and burning. When they finally find a way into the city and a warehouse where they take refuge they are contacted by a couple Seals who fill them in on what is going on. Completely cut off from the world they soon discover that in order to stay alive and possibly find a way back to the states they must now work with the Taliban to fight a common enemy far more dangerous than either could imagine. Its a non stop action packed story of survival and the beginning of a great new series.\n",

There was a good cast of characters and a fast-moving plot, but the second half I didn&#8217;t love quite as much. Fast-paced is always good for me, but the ending especially seemed quite rushed. There was also an odd plot twist that didn&#8217;t seem to fit with the overall theme of the story, and things got quite violent and didn&#8217;t make much sense to me. I enjoyed the dynamic between the two sisters (being a sister myself) but I didn&#8217;t think other relationships needed to be highlighted as much as they were.

            "I appreciated Sproul weighing in on this topic. Those who have read other works on pro-life works (see my review of Scott Klusendorf's work) will not find anything dramatically new here. Yet it's good to read and review the pro-life's argument. One thing that stood out as unique in this book was actually George Grant's preface. Grant summarized the current landscape in our society, political sphere and culture as the result of the abortion debate since Roe vs. Wade. This fascinating essay filled with footnotes by Grant puts into perspective for the Christian the extent of how much the abortion controversy has seeped into so many spheres of our lives today. The book is worth reading for the preface alone. Getting into Sproul's actual work I do appreciate how the author does deal with various objections given against the prolife position. I was reminded that more women have been known to have been killed by abortion after Roe vs. Wade than before it which makes the back alley abortion argument for legalizing abortion kind of ironic. Concerning the argument that the fetus is part of the woman's body, Sproul bring modern study of cells to bear, noting that babies have a different genetic fingerprint than the mother. The more interesting part of the book is the appendix that ended up being a rather lengthy testimony of a medical expert on the status of the embryo. Perhaps a little too lengthy. Sproul could have had his arguments tighter and I say this because I've seen other works that have made it air tight in their presentation. For those who might want to read an introductory work or to remind and refresh their prolife apologetics I can recommend this work.\n",

            "Okay, so. I don't know what made me read this book, because the synopsis is totally not my style. There are wayyyyy too many novels about peeps with &#34;broken pasts&#34; and the lovers that bring them back to life. Basically cliche upon cliche wrapped in a pretty new cover. But I bit the bullet and bought it.For a while, I was totally digging it. The angsty teen in high school, woe-is-me beginning was very reminiscent of novels past from Fictionpress, a website where some of my favorite authors first got their start. I initially was very excited to muddle through the lives of Bronagh and Dominic because of that fact.Bronagh is the one with the troubled past, as her parents were killed when she was young and she was brought up by her sister, Branna. This could have been extremely emotional and riveting, as it's been a successful ploy many-a-time, however it wasn't executed well. We're constantly told that Bronagh pushes people away and can't connect with any friends. And I say told because it's basically a textbook case of show, not tell. I couldn't connect with her at all on that point.She meets Dominic, one of five insanely hot brothers that move to Dublin (hear the cliche?) and he instantly wants her because she's the one woman to turn him down. I'll admit I did enjoy the bit of cat and mouse between them. Had Dominic actually possessed any redeeming qualities, I may have bought his douche-nugget routine. He constantly belittles and mocks the her to the point where I was giving my kindle serious WTF looks when she would stop-drop-and-roll in the middle of an argument to suck his tongue in her mouth.The entire plot was completely unbelievable; so much so that during the climax I was flipping through the pages in disbelief. Not only was the story a thin on plot, it also severely lacked in characterization. Dominic has to be one of the worst hero's since Travis Maddox. He, and I mean this literally, picked fights with people at least once during every. single. scene. Who does that? He had serious anger issues and in no way did I find that attractive. Nor was I fanning myself at the fact that he professes his love and then immediately speaks about babies and marriage. Hello, was I the only one with furrowed brows after that?So, in conclusion, a mildly entertaining, albeit absolutely unbelievable story that should be read if you don't really need a shot of realism to bring the characters to life. If you enjoy very &#34;lightweight&#34; novels that don't require a lot of thought and totally dig the uber-fake-alpha males that are also crazy and need to lay off the testosterone injections, snatch this up!\n",

This is a wonderful spin on this tale, that has you caught up in its so ell from the very first page and doesn't let you go until the final word, and while this is a sort of happy for now you know there is more to come.Loved the character of Luna, as heroine who can take care of herself doesn't pull any punches and lands an awful lot of them, what's not to love, Gabe is a tortured soul and this comes through so well in the writing, you feel for him and just like in the original you are willing them to fall in love. Never forget the importance of the other characters and they all have their parts to play and they are wonderful. This breathes new life into the story that never grows old and will hold your attention and have you wanting more.I received a free copy for an honest review\n",

            "I will add Arlo Crawford to my list of favorite authors! Although I am pretty sure this is his debut novel, I certainly will look forward to further books by Arlo. His writing style is great and he makes you feel like one of his friends, who he is telling this story to. He is very honest about not wanting to follow his parents as to owning & running a productive farm as a business. He can see what it has done to them & so far, continues to do to them - the tedium work, constant pressure, demanding business that never lets up, dealing with hired hands, etc., etc.. He knows that there is a better way to make money, but that there is a certain love of a farm that surpasses other income avenues as well. He loves his farm; it's just that he sees the beauty more than the negatives that it holds. His descriptions of that beauty - the sights and smells of the farm & how it can get into your blood are wonderful and draw you in - I savored his depictions of what he felt as to the beauty side. But, a farm is really a LOT of work-more than he is willing to do endlessly! Frankly, I hated for this book to end. I could have read on and on, but sadly, it did end. I myself, grew up on a tiny 5 acre farm in rural Pennsylvania, on which we raised potatoes and chickens. Of course, we had other animals too, but they did not produce the same income that we had from the chickens. Even that was a lot of work, which I remember well. So, in some parts of his book, I could understand where Arlo was coming from and enjoyed that, now that I have so many years since that part of my life to remember. I think that this book is wonderful and the writing even more so!\n",

            "&#8220;Friends from Damascus&#8221; is (more-or-less) part of the bigger story of the origins of the group of &#8220;rogue&#8221; assassins, known as Friends from Damascus, who take out world bad-guy terrorists, operating outside the boundaries and restraints of any national or political organization. Their funding remains mysterious, but their determination to kill terrorists who endanger civilization is clear and unambiguous. They simply kill them without much emotion connected to the assassinations. Naturally the entire world of terrorist organizations as well as legitimate governments seek them. Thus their operations are highly secretive. They live on the edge of exposure and their own annihilation.In this book, Mr. Happy traces the recruitment of two of the people who become primary players in the small group of self-appointed assassins, Brett/Rene and Talia/Mona. Naturally they become personally entangled and eventually in each other find the love that has escaped them all their lives. The first part of the book (about half) is slow and almost entirely &#8220;background.&#8221; Though necessary, it&#8217;s still slow.Mr. Happy has a tendency to create &#8220;superwomen&#8221; in all his books. Talia is no exception. She is a walking, talking, breathing death machine, with all the skills necessary to kill anyone she meets, besides being an emergency room doctor. But Talia nearly meets her maker in the book&#8217;s denouement in Lebanon.  However, as we read these thrilling episodes, Brett and his deadly-merry band of assassins eventually rescue her. Skipping ahead, Brett and Talia team up in all ways, and Talia joins the Friends&#8217; Group. This revelation is not a spoiler. It could not have happened in any other way, and such was obvious from the very beginning. How many people die in this book?  It&#8217;s an unbelievably high number!!Some of the action is a bit overboard and sketchy enough to cause the reader to suspend disbelief &#8211; not always possible for this reader.  Too much of the hairy escapes just don&#8217;t seem very possible and disbelief wins the day all too often. A writer shouldn&#8217;t force his readers to disbelieve plot and action episodes.And yet, it&#8217;s a very good story, very well-written, upbeat and assertively positive in its thrust with attempts at ethical reconstruction of behavior.  Mr. Happy may not write anything remotely resembling literature, but he writes a darn good story. It&#8217;s a bit like reading one of the Gabriel Allon series by Daniel Silva, only with more technology and a staggeringly effective support group &#8211; and mercifully without the Israeli politics.Thus, it&#8217;s a 4 on Amazon&#8217;s scale.  The entire &#8220;Damascus&#8221; series is very well done. Kudos to Mr. Happy.\n",

            "This is a very short story that not only introduces us to key characters in the Crimson Shadow series, but gives us important information about the purpose of the Odin clan. We meet Emily and Joseph Stryker when she finds him injured in an alley. After a few protestations that he would be fine, Joseph leaves the alley. Emily is confused by her reaction to him when she's never before felt drawn to a man showing interest in her.Back at the Odin clan's mansion, Joseph continues his work of building tolerance among the mythos community for more than just their own kind. With the help of his friend, Depok, they have been hard at work creating laws and establishing order in the mythos community. If they succeed, mythos everywhere will be safer and continue to remain secret from humans. Their efforts are hindered by rogues who see their way of life suppressed by this upstart clan and its leader.Complicating everything are the feelings Joseph and Emily have for each other, something forbidden since Emily is 100% human. But what good is any Crimson Shadow story without a bit of the forbidden to make things sweeter? Of course there's conflict, arrogance born of self-confidence in ones ability, nobility in striving to prevent friends from being injured or killed. And let's not forget Trepis, such a pretty \"kitty\" who behaves much like Emily's cat, Aries.I really enjoyed having this background on the Odin clan and what they were trying to accomplish. Their purpose echoes life in a very real way as they strive to better the world in which they live. They are attacked by a group who believes Stryker, and by extension the Odin clan, have no business trying to regulate how anyone in the mythos community live. Sound familiar?Of course it's not all smooth sailing, but it wouldn't be an interesting read if it was. The characters are, once again, wonderful, and the editing was nearly perfect. Very glad I added this book to my library. I'm looking forward to reading more from both this author and the world of Crimson Shadow.\n",

I am normally not much of a historical romance reader. I typically like my books dark or hot and steamy, however this one was thrilling and enjoyable. I found myself wanting to keep turning pages to find out what would happen next with the differences in the towns people, as well as the romance going on with the two lead characters. The romance was sweet and I loved how forward the main characters were with their views during that time period. The acceptance and admiration, along with the constant denial of feelings for sake of the townships views made me fall even more for the story. Despite all the challenges, love and a little progress was made and the story ended with a HEA feel.Would recommend to anyone looking for a page turning sweet read.\n",

            "*Contains spoilers for Gifted: A Donovan Circus Novel (book 1 in the series)*Burned picks up a few weeks after the final events of Gifted.Lucy is still reeling with guilt over killing Felix in self-defense, and also reeling with her indecision over her love life. Avoiding Gabriel and Keegan makes things a tad bit easier, but Lucy knows it's only a matter of time before she must make a choice.On top of her emotional struggle, Lucy and the Donovan Circus family are about to encounter a new threat...One evening whilst strolling along the grounds, Lucy is grabbed. A knife is held to her neck and words are spoken into her ear...&#34;Tell Sheffield that Medved is hunting him.Tell him. Tell him the Bear is coming.&#34;Medved the shifter is a villain with immense power. Sheffield quickly calls on an old friend&#8212;a friend who happens to run a competing circus&#8212;for help.The Donovan crew head off to Grayson Circus to form an alliance in hopes of beating Medved, but end up getting the opposite of a warm welcome.While trying to win over the Grayson group, learning more secrets about her father daily, and fighting with her own feelings, Lucy is ready to explode.Will Medved and his army be enough to take her and her friends down?- - -What a follow-up!!! Gifted was great, but Burned?ASTOUNDING! Liz Long is quickly moving up in the ranks of my all-time favorite authors!The first thing I have to note is that the romance in this book is superbly done. I am so impressed with the fact that Liz didn't make it the focal point, but kept it alive with passionate and meaningful interactions between Lucy and both her love interests. I also like that I was surprised at her choice once it was made. I won't spoil it, of course, but I think you'll be surprised as well. I imagine it's quite a feat to keep up the suspense with both Gabriel and Keegan enough to make it realistic and yet still a surprise outcome. Does that make sense? I hope so. lol Anyway, the romance is beautiful and moving and very much heart-wrenching at times.After reading the first book in the series, the characters really stood out to me. I remember being impressed with the sheernumber of characters and how each one stood out so completely, remaining clear and memorable in my head even weeks after I read the book. We get all those same characters in this novel, plus some. With the Donovan crew spending a good portion of the book at the Grayson Circus, we meet new people! And the same thing happened with this book... I found them all SO SO memorable! Not only new characters, but new Gifts&#8212;some very interesting and fun ones at that. You can definitely expect new friends as well as enemies. :)Lucy is a lovable protagonist. I found that she really stepped up in this book. She was going through emotional turmoil for many different reasons, but embraced her role as leader even when she wanted to do anything but that. She never asked to be caught up in a war her father and Sheffield began. She never wanted to have to hurt someone using her Gift. She never asked for her Gift, period. But she grew. She learned. She overcame. She is inspiring and I very much enjoyed reading from her POV; enjoyed going on that journey of growth with her.As for the new villain. The Bear has quite a presence. This guy isn't just evil, he's freakin' insane! Sociopathic, even. He's definitely a memorable baddie! The action that accompanies his battle with Lucy and her friends is pure awesomeness. I felt like I was watching a movie. Liz did a perfect job of writing the action and keeping up the suspense. I was enthralled and glued to the pages.All in all, Burned left me completely satisfied. The characters, both old and new, are amazing and very stand-out among the hoards of New Adult characters out there. The romance is sexy and intense. The storyline progresses nicely and leaves things open for a third book without torturing us with a cliffhanger ending! Please bring on another Donovan Circus novel... like now! I definitely recommend this book (as well as Gifted) to anyone who enjoys a unique, fast-paced NA novel with a paranormal twist. :)\n",

            "Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.Kay, or Katie, is a wealthy socialite living in Manhattan. Although her family comes from money, she doesn&#8217;t live the life of a trust fund brat, instead choosing to man the helm of her family&#8217;s charitable foundation (much to her mother&#8217;s chagrin). For the past three years she has been dating Josh, another trust fund brat (although estranged from his father) and they are engaged to be married. When she walks in on Josh and his former girlfriend, Kay realizes the mistake she is about to make and breaks it off.In order to help the austere Kay get over her breakup with Josh, her friend Michelle takes her to a sex club, Sensations (against Michelle&#8217;s better judgment). At the club, Kay has an anonymous sexual encounter with a man who upends her entire world. Even though their all-night sex session took place under the mask of darkness, she is immediately smitten. She remembers the smell of him, his voice. He too was electrified by their contact and can&#8217;t get her off her mind.Luke Davenport is the owner and CEO of one of the largest PR firms in Manhattan. He is still getting over the loss of his wife Roslyn, some four years earlier. He is the single father to a five-year-old daughter, Olivia, or Livy. When the fourth anniversary of his wife&#8217;s death rolls around, his friends and co-workers from the office manage to convince Luke to accompany them to Sensations. He, like Kay, is not looking for the kink that seems to be surrounding them at the club, but rather a night of hot companionship, some no strings attached hot sex with a stranger.The next day, the body of Ms. Carmen, the manager of the club is found strangled and soon Luke is arrested for the murder. Unfortunately, Kay is the only one that can serve as an alibi witness to Luke&#8217;s whereabouts, however in coming forward, she risks not only the name of her family, but her position with her family&#8217;s foundation as well. Can the connection between Kay and Luke be enough for Kay to risk it all? If Luke isn&#8217;t the one that killed Ms. Carmen, who is?Wrapped In Shadows is a book of suspense and mystery wrapped up in a hot romance package. The connection and resulting sexual encounters between Kay and Luke are hot. Luke is a hunk of an alpha male, not only because of his prowess in the bedroom and his dedication to Kay, but also in the commitment he has made to his daughter. She is the number one priority in his life and it is refreshing to see that.There are several twists and turns you won&#8217;t see coming, making this the proverbial page-turner. I loved the relationship between Kay and Michelle (who happens to work for Luke) and the different ends of the spectrum they represent. Michelle helps to draw Kay out of the vanilla, white bread world she is accustomed to and really live. Not only to experience the carnal pleasures of the world, but also to take the chance on real love, not the kind that is more of a business merger between families, meant to benefit them socially and financially. Kay wants to marry for love, not power.Wrapped In Shadows is a solid four star read. It is gripping and well written, however I could have done without some of the back and fourth angst between not only Kay and Luke, but Kay and her mother as well. Kay isn&#8217;t the strongest of heroines and I would have liked her a bit more if she had more of a backbone. In the end she pulled it off and got it together, but I feel I may have had more of a connection with her if it had been earlier in the book. Ms. Eugene did an excellent job of creating the villain(s) and making their motivations clear. I think the biggest thing that bothered me though was Luke&#8217;s daughter, Livy. I loved their relationship, but it was the way in which Ms. Eugene depicted her with her speech that made it a little unbelievable. As a five year old, there was an awful lot of baby talk, but in the next chapter, she busts out the line of &#8220;who are these men?&#8221; For the most part her language seemed to be that of a 2-3 year old, not that of a kindergartner.Wrapped In Shadows is a standalone with an HEA. I highly suggest it for fans of romantic suspense. This is the first book I&#8217;ve written by Ms. Eugene and certainly not the last.\n",

            "Having been a family victim of a murder, I was fascinated in reading this novel that was written by a federal judge who has presided over a capital murder case.&#34;The Hanging Judge&#34; is the debut thriller by Michael Ponsor. It is excellent in many ways. It gives readers a view and perspective of courtroom drama in a capital murder case, along with what might and sometimes does happen behind the scenes.Personally, I am a lot like the main charater, David Norcross. I also have a lot of deep doubts about our legal system. Being a crime victim, I resent a clever defense attorney getting a criminal off the hook, when the villain is obviously very guilty.  However, I know that both the prosecutor and defense attorney are just doing the best job they can.Reading this novel was akin to watching a movie and not being able to do anything else until seeing what happens in the end. In a fiction movie or a fiction novel, writers can make their story have a good ending. Truth is, in reality, the bad guys don't always get what is coming to them. However, it could be a different matter when wicked people die - for this is not a free ride - everyone must pay for their deeds - good or bad.If you want to read a book that has lots of action and one that stirs up emotions, then you should read this excellent and well-written novel.Jeannie Walker (Award-Winning Author) &#34;Fighting the Devil&#34; - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder\n",

            "I'm a huge fan of Kristen's and have been for years but recently I must admit I've been disappointed with Own the Wind and Fire Inside and I didn't even consider reading Jagged but since I love the Fantasyland Series not reading Broken Dove wasn't an option.This book started really well, I loved all the characters involved and Kristen was weaving her magic, normally I read quickly which is both a blessing (I get to the end quicker so find out what's what) and a curse (if it's a good book it's over too quickly) but in this case due to personal issues it's taken me days to get through this which means I've been able to really get into it, and I was but I did take issue with Maddie's stupid mistake, now I know Maddie had to do something to annoy Apollo but I didn't find it believable, this is a woman who's street wise and has been on the run from her husband for years so I felt this was a cheap shot and I expect more from Kristen.I loved that all the main characters from the past books were here with their children.Golden Dynasty is one of my favourite Kristen books I can't remember how many times I've actually read this book, I also loved Wildest Dreams but Fantastical was for me a disappointment.One measure I use when judging books is if I'd read it again and to be honest I don't know if this is a book that I would read again, I'm not sure why but at the moment I can't see it happening, it makes me wonder where the four stars came from even though I loved the characters and enjoyed the book for me it was lacking something, I'm not sure what but it makes me wonder if we do in fact have the old Kristen back. I am concerned that Kristen's books of late are not living up to earlier potential, this one started really well and I liked all the characters but it's not calling out for me to re-read, now I know not every book can be everything to every reader but I'm wondering if she's spreading herself too thin she has a lot of different series's going on at the moment I know I'm waiting for the next 'burg book as well as The Third Series.This book has reminded me how much I liked Frey and Finnie as well as Apollo so I'm going back to re-read Wildest Dreams now which of course will be followed by Golden Dynasty yet again.I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars. I gave 4 since I liked the characters and enjoyed the book but if I compare it to At Peace, Until the Sun Falls from the Sky, Golden Dynasty, Motorcycle Man the list goes on and on it makes me wonder if it truly deserves the 4 stars, would 3 be a more accurate rating?\n",

I don't think I've ever read a book where I rooted for the characters as much as I did this book. The characters are amazing. They are real, they are vibrant and you really believe they exist somewhere out there. The storyline is so well developed, and so well written that it just draws you right in, and doesn't let go!Who hasn't wished that someone who was bugging them wasn't there any longer?  I know I have... and I hate to think about how I would feel if something truly did happen to that person, the guilt would be overwhelming.  That's exactly what the author portrays, and very eloquently in this book.  It takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, love, hate, grief, loss and most of all, hope.I'm a teacher, and always looking for something my reluctant readers will enjoy... this is it!  What a wonderful gift Michael Scanlon has given us! Obviously you don't have to  be a teenager to enjoy this book, anyone who enjoys a good story and good writing will love it!This is definitely an author I want to read more from!

            "In life, we hear voices. No, not the ones you may be thinking about. Voices of fear, doubt, accusation and more. These are the voices that Steven Furtick addresses in his new book Crash The Chatterbox: Hearing God&#8217;s Voice Above All Others. I am grateful to Multnomah for giving me a free copy to review.First, the things I enjoyed about the book. This book will be very helpful to many. The book is geared for those who are struggling. Struggling with doubts, fears, and more. It is encouraging. It is honest. It is Biblical. If you find yourself struggling with some of these &#8220;voices,&#8221; this book will be an encouragement.Secondly, there were a few things I did not care for personally. This book is different from Furtick&#8217;s first two. His first two is built around Biblical stories, this is not. The book is Biblical, but there is a little too much psychology for my taste. I would have rather it be built around a character like his last books. It is not bad by any means, I just felt like the flow of the last books was much better than this one. It personally did not scratch me where I itch, but I know that many will find this very helpful and encouraging.All in all, this is not a bad book at all. If you find yourself trying to discern God&#8217;s voice and will in your life, then by all means, pick yourself up a copy!\n",

            "After reading book 3 of this series I commented that, &#8220;There was less action this time around, and I admit I'm hoping book four ramps things up a bit.&#8221;  It seems Ms. Jacobey was listening, as book 4, EXPOSED, moves Tori back into her old renegade world, whether she likes it or not.  Hence, there&#8217;s plenty of danger and intrigue for her to deal with, as well as a new-found family tie.  She also has to do some soul searching about what and who she really is and what she really wants,  while also coming to terms with abilities and desires that she is, intellectually, not completely at ease with.  She&#8217;s learning something we all have to learn-- to embrace our darker side and accept that&#8217;s also an integral 'part' of who we are but doesn't completely define us.  These elements make the book somewhat grittier than the last one, which will please most fans of this series, I think.  Of course, the book ends on a cliffhanger.  Once again, we are given a glimpse of just how deep the rabbit hole may go as we witness the forces that surround Tori as they discuss their nefarious plans.  There&#8217;s still a lot of mysteries to be solved, and a long road for Tori to travel before she has true freedom from her past so she can build a new and better future with the man she loves.\n",

This book begins in the airport, while Kayla is waiting to board a plane to go to her younger sister's wedding.  Kayla is not looking forward to the trip, because she know's her parents will be constantly harassing her about having a boyfriend.  Kayla has it all thought out.  She has a made up boyfriend, but no one she can take on the trip with her.  To top it off, she has a fear of flying, so she is going stir crazy while waiting to board the plane.  In walks the dashing, incomparable, Cooper Shillings, who begins a banter with the unassuming Southern beauty and gets drawn in to her innocence and her beautiful legs for miles.Cooper realizes that Kayla is afraid of flying, and he is a sucker for a beautiful damsel in distress.  So, when he finds out she has a first class ticket, he goes to the counter and trades in his coach seat so he can be in the seat next to her to help her through her fear.  Kayla is a self-reliant woman who knows what she wants, and also knows that she doesn't need a man to help complete her.  Cooper is an ex-marine with his own baggage, and they are both commit-a-phobics.  Before you know it, Cooper has Kayla thinking of other things...way hotter things...than flying.  She gets drunk on the plane and all her insecurities are forgotten with one kiss from this sexy-swoon worthy ex-marine.  He lays the charm on thick and before you know it, they decide that he will act as her boyfriend for the weekend.  What could go wrong, right?!  They both are all in for this short wild ride, and I do mean ride ladies...of a lifetime.Cooper has convinced himself that he doesn't need anyone in his life and he has a lot of guilt over the war. He thinks he is damaged goods.  He has a soft spot for people in trouble, and Kayla has him whirling. Cooper helps Kayla lose all her inhibitions and the two of them have some earth shattering, mind blowing, up close and personal sexcapades in very public places!!!  Cooper was sensual, hot, mesmerizing, tantalizing, and oozing sex appeal in every way possible!  This was a fast paced, quick read novella, full of excitement, and the thrills kept coming.

You can save yourself time and money by reading the teaser chapters or perhaps you'll decided it's for you. The h interviews for a job with the world famous, reclusive author, who has come to live in her small town to get away from the press. She's up against her 2 best friends, who never said anything to her. It's one of the most immature things I've ever read. I felt like the story should have been set in high school. The way the H and h interact throughout the book, is like 2 teenagers, who alternate between talking and not talking to each other. I'm never a fan of a character who is in another relationship whilst the story is developing between the leads. We read about her having sex with her boyfriend near the beginning and the relationship continues through a large part of the book. It was tacky and verged on cheating.

            "This was a real page turner.  Debbie has an epiphany of sorts when she is on the set with her latest adult film. Returning home, she discovers her husband has died with a underaged girl. The two were electrocuted while filming the girl's \"audition\" in a hot tub. Only this could happen in Hollywood. Debbie is left with a huge debt of her husband's and a local thug named Richard Ness is threatening to kill her if she doesn't make good on the debt. Debbie, feisty and strong, pretty much tells him where to go. She decides she's had enough of the adult film industry and wants out. She embarks on a journey to reconnect with her family while planning her husband's funeral. One would think her late husband was a dog, but it turns out he really cared for Debbie and was kind to her. For all his flaws, he was a decent husband. Ness sells her debt to a mean thug named Coco Manetti, who tries to collect any way possible. Luckily Debbie discovers she has an unexpectedly powerful friend on her side who ends up helping her out.The characters are colorful and well-developed. I like the fact there's a gay character who loves theater; you might think he's a stereotype, but he ends up being far from that once you learn more about him. You can just visualize them from Mosley's descriptions. Although a bit raw at times, Debbie's story has a gritty realness but in the end, she manages to triumph, but not in the way you might expect. I like how Debbie evolves and grows during the story; in spite of what happens, she remains strong and committed to starting a new life.

            "THE STORY:In IMMAGICA, Rosaline Clayton is given an amulet by her father for her 15th birthday. He tells her to find the book in the attic and go to Immagica, to save the magical world, and himself. She doesn't understand anything that's going on. When Rosaline and her brother Elliot find the book, they are taken into Immagica but are separated. There she meets fantastical creatures and makes new friends, all the while trying to find her little brother. But in order to find him, she needs to defeat the dragon terrorizing the realm. But there is more to the dragon than she could have ever imagined, and she learns things about her family that are better left in the dark.I absolutely LOVED IMMAGICA! I'd say that IMMAGICA is more like an epic fantasy than just regular old fantasy, because well it's EPIC! We have a young girl coming of age, being taken to a magical world and meeting magical creatures, who goes on a journey or quest to save the world from destruction. IMMAGICA drew me in and I didn't want to stop reading. I sincerely hope that this will be made into a series, because I would love to read more adventures in Immagica.THE CAST:Rosaline: Our heroine just turned 15 years old, and was given her birthrights after overhearing some strange things her parents were discussing behind closed doors. She enters Immagica with a troubled mind and heart and just wants to find her brother and go home. But as she travels Immagica and meets it's citizens and the beauty that could be destroyed, she realizes that she can't let this world and it's people die.Elliot: He shares the same birthday as his sister Rosaline, but is two years younger. He gets sucked into Immagica along with Rosaline, but is separated from her when they arrive. While Rosaline's story is playing out, Elliot's own story is being written.Brynn: She is the first person Rosaline meets in Immagica. They don't exactly hit it off at first, but as they journey, they form a strong friendship and loyalty to each other.Ira: He is the black unicorn that Rosaline called to her so she could travel easier. The bond that Ira and Rosaline form is very, very strong, and I doubt it can ever be broken.Sebille & Orin: The fairies! These two are always playing with Rosaline's hair and poking her in the cheeks, but don't let their carefree appearance fool you. They have their own magic and strengths that you wouldn't expect from such tiny creatures. They love Rosaline very deeply.Lex: The Protector of the very heart of Immagica. He's cute with his geeky quirkiness, but when it comes to the protection of the Eye, he won't let anything threaten it. The Eye holds all the knowledge of Immagica, everyone who has ever visited has their book there. There's a little crush formed between him and Rosaline (and let's just say it's reciprocated).The Dragon: I don't want to say too much about him because it would give a lot away, but he's the bad guy trying to destroy Immagica.THE VILLAIN:As I mentioned above, the dragon is the villain of this tale. He's trying to destroy Immagica and is evil to the core. He has the gryphons working for him on destroying the towers surrounding the Eye. All of them have fallen but the North Tower. The dragon has a surprising connection with the Clayton family.THE ROMANCE:There isn't much romance in IMMAGICA, until Rosaline and her friends reach the Eye and she meets Lex, the protector. And even then it's just little hints. But that's what made it so perfect. It was that awkward moment when a crush is first formed, and there's all the nervousness and blushing. It was just all around sweet and I really want to see more between these two (hint hint series).THE ACTION:There are epic battles all around in IMMAGICA. But it was the battle with the dragon toward the end that really stands out, as it should. That fight was one of the moments in the book that really had me on the edge of my seat and holding my breath waiting for the outcome. And that's all I'm going to say about that, so if you want to see how it ends, you should pick up this AMAZING book!\n",

            "I bought this book after, once again, falling in love with the cover. I actually spotted this book about a month ago when I was gearing up for my 2014 Reading Challenge of 100 books. I was not too enamored with the plot, since I had no idea what it was about, but something in me was excited to read this book.And there are 5 reasons why this book did not work for me.1. It's a lot like the Hunger Games, After the Fear, Vampire Academy and Enclave, but it doesn't deliver (as my post title suggests).The main character, Amy, is supposed to be like Katniss in the Hunger Games, but her character development was seriously lacking. I mean, the girl was tough and did whatever she could for Baby, but sometimes she acted in ways that didn't make sense. Example, Amy's supposed to be hardened from living in the After, but she feels guilt when she sets Them on the man that was going to rape her? Ummm...okay.Now let's talk about this books relation to After the Fear. After the Fear was a brilliantly plotted book with a strong main character and a little romance to keep us interested. Now, the place where In the After went wrong with this connection to After the Fear is the awkward insta-romance between Amy and Rice. I mean, come on. So she just learned to lean on him when needed, reveal her soul to him, and just love him without much effort? That is not real life.Now let's talk about Vampire Academy. I kind of had the feeling that some of the snarky comments made by Amy were supposed to be super funny and witty like Rose from VA, but all of them (literally ALL of them) fell flat.Enclave. Good ol' Enclave. I felt the writer tried hard to write succinctly like Ann Aguirre, but all she managed to do was make me feel detached from her characters (which I go into more detail below).2. I literally felt nothing for these characters. Even Baby.I don't feel the writer developed the characters enough to make me have a real enough connection with the characters. Any of them, well minus Kay, but only because in my mind she's a super hot version of Pearl from the Vampire Diaries (the TV show version). And I'm just into women, to put it lightly. Any ways, I felt the writer tried to &#34;show&#34; the relationship between everyone in the book, but she missed many valuable opportunities to show true emotions in the characters. I mean, how is that Amy could leave her dad behind so easily when he seems to be such a large part of her?3. The way the book was structured made my stomach hurt.If you've read But I Love Him by Amanda Grace (which is a good book) you're familiar with books that start from the end and work to the beginning. Well, In the After does both. Yeah, you heard me; it does both. The story is told from the beginning, giving a break down of what happened in the world; but during all of this, the story is told from the POV of Amy who's in the Ward. I have a feeling this was meant to be ground breaking and moving, but mostly it was just annoying.4. The information spills.I'm a huge history person, but the way information was spilled on me ALL AT ONCE made my head hurt. I mean, there was no &#34;breaking it to them gently&#34; in this book. When it came to revelations and twists, so much information was revealed the real effect of the information was lost. This book literally had SO MUCH potential, but it fell flat so many times.5. It felt a little too &#34;I'm writing for the next book&#34; for me.Many things were left open in this book. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought series were supposed to be able to stand on their own if the first book didn't do very well?Overall, I finished this book in one day, but not because I loved it. This book was interesting, the plot idea was fresh and new, but the material was so stale there was no substance for me to get caught up on. I mean, this is a 400+ page book, yet I finished it so fast because the writing is so...fluffy. And not in a good way.Now, I do plan on reading the next book (since I'm doing a reading challenge), but I do not necessarily recommend this book.\n",

            "Americanah made for an extensive and interesting discussion in our book club.  It's the book most explicitly focused on race that we've read (complementing the more novelistic Age of Iron and Continental Drift) over our 14 years.  It had us contemplating more deeply subjects that are all around us every day, in a way that Animal, Vegetable, Miracle had us really thinking about food.  This book had us thinking about the day-to-day issues surrounding hair, for example.  So the book was most appreciated for its ideas.  And we also liked its structure/style, incorporating blog postings to complement the story line and to bring home what the central character thinks about, and what she does for a living.  But the plot seemed more opinion -- a long essay -- than a novel.  And the central character was rather frustrating with her personal decisions that weren't well explained.  All-in we were all glad that we read it (or at least talked about it, as applicable...), and gave it an average grade of around B+, in a range of B- to A-.  In any event, we did have a very nice evening together.  And I have some leftover pasta for lunch today.\n",

            "After reading A Casual Weekend Thing and Holding Out for a Fairy Tale, I knew that I really liked this author. Sex & Sourdough surpassed my expectations. It was a thoroughly touching and heartwarming read. I loved every moment. I often find that books have themes, and I'd say the theme of Sex & Sourdough is living life. One foot in front of the other, just keep moving.Anders, though he doesn't realize it until later, has been in an abusive relationship for nearly three years. From the outside, it seems like it should be obvious, but strangely, it isn't always, at least when it's happening to you. People rationalize, both not wanting to feel weak and not wanting to be seen as weak, so their abusers get much further than they should. Luckily, Anders manages to get a taste of what life without Joel is like and breaks up with him before it's too late.Kevin, aka Sourdough, befriends Anders when he starts hiking, and undoubtedly keeps him safe and alive. He also gives Anders the experience he needs to figure out what he want to do with his life. Through the way Kevin deals with his own problems, and still manages to put one foot in front of the other, Anders sees that he can live his life as well, even if he hasn't quite figured out what he wants to do with it.Once I started reading this book, I really could not put it down. It made me smile and it made me cry (though my tears were not for what I expected them to be for) and then smile again. This book will definitely go on the reread list.\n",

            "*contains spoilers* Definitely one of the best reads I had in a while. Mythology had always been my favorite and I tend to read Mythology-based novels after reading Mythology by Edith Hamilton. Deer in Headlights did not disappoint. I find the idea of the gods of Olympus playing a game novel and interesting. The subplots/backstories added more meat/substance and had no issues with the characters or how they were characterized. Love the lines/dialogues. I definitely saw/read distinct or unique individuals. Their struggles and how they responded to their inner and outer conflicts were rather understandable (though I do not believe in superstition but a superstitious person would definitely act they way she did given his past). It is also nice to note or to discover that the goddess of love and beauty might have problems with love. I also felt for Apollo and his Daphne. The author's take on their story was a nice treat. The way it was presented - the narration, the pacing, the flow - was just right and could be improved, perhaps tone down repetitions in the exposition . I can't wait to know what happens next. I give this four stars and I recommend others to read this novel.\n",

And the things that he does just to tried to break them apart Ben just disappoint me.I really love the character of Grace but she also made me mad but for only like to second. I had to understand that she is a mother, and the way that her characters turned out to be it broke my heart.I really did enjoy reading this book, and can't wait to read the rest of this series, once again I have to say Author Kim Karr THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING ME TO THIS AMAZING CHARACTERS AND THIS AWESOME BOOK.\n",

            "What a great read, and so informative too. It's rare that someone of Ferreira's technical caliber (he's a professor of astrophysics at the prestigious University of Oxford) can also write well. Note that, at the time of this review, he has over 360 published items (e.g., articles, books) and he is cited over 1300 times in other works. Nowhere does he use the title &#34;Doctor,&#34; and I couldn't find any reference thereof. But in trying to find it, I was duly impressed with his credentials otherwise. Maybe that's why he's a professor at a major university even if (and that's not certain) he doesn't have a PhD (he might, I just can't verify that).His writing is excellent, both in style and in technical merit (that is, his grammatical competence is high). Because of this, the book is quite accessible to the lay reader with an interest in something as mind-boggling as the Theory of General Relativity. Rather than trudging through dense text and trying to figure out what the author is saying, readers of this book can enjoy a nicely narrated explanation of what has gone on with the Theory of General Relativity from its inception to where it is today.In this review, I won't explain anything about this very famous theory. I assume the reader of this review has not been on a deserted island since 1905 and thus has been amply exposed to it through at least some of the pop culture, thousands of articles, common mentions, and even movies that have explained, amplified, or even misrepresented it since that time. If you were stranded on a deserted island all this time, please accept my apologies; I did not mean to slight you.This book isn't a tutorial on the Theory of General Relativity. Whatever you know of it from the popular culture or the reading of relevant books for the layperson is sufficient background for reading this book. It's really about the human drama that this theory evoked. And that is quite a story. As Ferreira tells us in the Prologue and then shows us through his writing, the Theory of General Relativity has taken on a life of its own. It occupied, or perhaps consumed, many of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century. And it is a career topic for many brilliant minds in this century.In telling this story, Ferreira delves into how science and culture have responded to the Theory of General Relativity. But his focus is mostly on the scientists, with their cliques, battles of ideas, and personal feuds. The intrigues and backstabbing have much in common with a season of the 80's television show Dallas. People who challenged the orthodoxy or the &#34;powers that be&#34; sometimes found their lives destroyed (even though they were right).What many people don't know is the Theory of General Relativity actually fell by the wayside in the larger physics community, and stayed in the ditch for many years. Then suddenly, it made a big comeback. It's now central to emerging science. As Ferreira so deftly shows us, the Theory of General Relativity has value in taking us further in both physics and cosmology.When the topic of a book is the Theory of General Relativity, perhaps the most relevant question a reviewer can answer is, &#34;What about the math?&#34; Being a quant myself (MBA, with an engineering undergrad), I happen to like math. Use math to explain something to me, and you help me understand. Except when it comes to the strange, very advance, mind-numbing math used by physicists and their ilk. Count me out. Ferreira does the reader the favor of not trying to prove he's an egghead. There's no math to mystify the reader. Just a great story, well-told.Just as an example of the threads that Ferreira pursues in this book, consider black holes. These are mentioned in several chapters, and of course you know that means he talks about Stephen Hawking. The drama around this one celestial object makes for a story in itself. It was that story that made Hawking a pop icon. &#34;Hawking radiation&#34; solved a major puzzle regarding black holes.This book consists of 14 chapters across 235 pages. In addition, it has an informative Prologue, extensive notes, and an impressive bibliography.Technical note on this review:I reviewed a paperback Advance Reading Copy for Amazon Vine. Normally, these advance copies are rife with copy editing errors. That was not at all the case with this one. Over the past few years, I've noticed a distinct difference between authors from the UK and those from the USA, in terms of understanding and implementing Standard Written English (SWE). Sad to say, my countrymen do quite poorly in this regard, nearly every time. Ferreira is a UK author, and his writing reflects the much higher standards there.A disclaimer at the front said there may be corrections. As I write this review, I cannot recall a single error of either a technical or style nature. Well done, Mr. Ferreira.\n",

To him, she represents all the misfortune in his life as he tries to keep her at arm&#8217;s length and far away from his heart.Their journey towards truth is riddled with treachery and danger from an unlikely source. Will they find their way back to each other, or will his need for revenge outweigh the love he feels in her arms?My Thoughts: Gemma, a woman with lots of strengths and courage, was rather impetuous early in the story. Even so, she was a women that I could relate to. Shattered heart as a young girl, but not shattered spirit. She rose to the occasion helping take care of her younger sister and learned what she could in managing a castle. Family was vitally important to her and when needed she heeded her father&#8217;s words.Both Gemma and Nicholas were hiding the truth from themselves, something we all do from time to time. Nicholas thought he was ONLY following the edicts of the king to go to Blackstone Castle and bring order to a serious situation. But he went to see Gemma wanting to exact revenge for his family betrayal. His family had suffered much from some trickery from Gemma&#8217;s family if not she herself. On the other hand, Gemma had been told the story that Nicholas&#8217;s family had tried to take her family down. In other words, she felt betrayed and would never seek another man as she had when young. They were not to be trusted.The king meant for them to wed and they could not refuse the king. The inner struggle each had not trusting the other from the past to the physical attraction present long ago and apparently still remains makes for a rocky start to any relationship. Nicholas, a knight in every sense of the word, had a job to do -- protect the castle, protect Gemma AND we found protect his heart. He sacrificed his own desires and almost sacrificed himself when he lost control and wasn&#8217;t able to protect anything at all. Gemma was willing to marry Nicholas to have protection for herself and her family. She knew that Nicholas would never be able to love her nor was she able to protect her heart. He loved. She loved. And neither understood anything. This plot made for an interesting and entertaining read.The story was evenly paced and complex enough to be interesting with a suspenseful feeling lurking since we don&#8217;t know why people are being killed. The formal medieval dialog helped provide a medieval setting. The story was a clean read.I think the story itself has opportunities for more turmoil creating further suspense and conflict between Gemma and Nicholas. And by doing so it gives the reader further insight into the primary characters of the read. On a couple of occasions I had difficulty accepting as factual what Gemma would do to bring herself into danger. She put herself into danger with little thought, yet I pictured her as intelligent and strong-willed with a good head on her shoulders. However, that being said, I enjoyed how she maneuvered to remove herself from danger and her repentance afterwards.All in all, I enjoyed and liked the story and know that Amy Mullen has a future in historical romance writing. It was an excellent first novel. For further information about the book or read an excerpt see earlier posting [...]\n",

The descriptions throughout the book make it so you can vividly imagine everything as it happens. This is a story of finding love and acceptance throughout one's life. The story will move you to tears, make you laugh, and make you recollect on your own past or that of a friend that may have had a tough go of it. Maggie has a rough childhood that ends up shaping her adult life. She ends up in foster care and pregnant at the age of 17. She marries young and loses her baby in a tragic accident. Her biological family is in and out of her life. She moves around a lot and is able tobe the glue that holds many of her loved ones together. Her spirit is strong and this story seems to be a therapy of sorts for her. I commend the author for tackling so many personal issues in a plausible and tangible way.

            "Forty years ago we last stepped foot on the Moon. Currently, with our occupation of the low-Earth orbit international space station, we are space residents. In the visionary Mission to Mars (National Geographic Society, 2013), moon-walker, space advocate, Gemini 12 and Apollo 11 astronaut, Buzz Aldrin, challenges us to take a further step and colonise Mars. Aldrin advocates bypassing the Moon and instead make progressive steps to mars via comets, asteroids and Mar&#8217;s moon Phobos. From Phobos astronauts using remote controlled robots will prepare the Mars landing site and habitats. Aldrin states that regular space travel to Mars would be too expensive with Apollo-style modular expendable components, instead favoring a gravity-powered spaceship cycling permanently between the Earth and Mars. Although strongly advocating for a US led enterprise Aldrin, thankfully, sees cooperation, rather than competition with China, Europe, Russia, India and Japan as being the way forward.Currently we have the Dutch company Mars One are recruiting people to be part of a permanent human settlement on Mars by 2023; the US commercial firm SpaceX have their Red Dragon proposal to put a sample-return mission to Mars by 2018 (seen as a necessary precursor by NASA to a human exploration); the Chinese have a long term plan for non-crewed flights to Mars by 2033 and crewed phase of missions to Mars during 2040-2060. Although the funding mechanisms and motivations are different these plans all make use of one idea or more from book The Case for Mars (Free Press, 1996, 2011). Written by aerospace engineer and founder of the Mars Society, Robert Zubrin, it is a meticulous and plausible way to settle Mars. Aldrin&#8217;s book is more broad and his ideas fit well with current technologies, US aspirations for asteroid capture and exploitation, and NASA&#8217;s focus on the planet Mars.The veteran Mars Exploration Rover, Opportunity, is still surprising us with its discoveries, more than nine years after the completion of its 90 day primary mission. While the sprightly youngster Curiosity is regularly rewriting and deepening our understanding of Mars - still only half-way through its three year primary mission.Appreciating what it takes to get a scientific laboratory wheeling its way across Mars is enticingly portrayed in another  new book Red Rover (Basic Books, 2013). This first-hand account is written by Roger Wiens, lead scientist for ChemCam - the laser zapping remote chemical analytical instrument onboard the rover Curiosity. It covers his involvement in robotic space exploration from his initiation in 1990 on the NASA Genesis probe to the joyous moment when Curiosity zapped its first rock in early 2013. If this piques your curiosity then the earlier Roving Mars: Spirit, Opportunity, and the exploration of the Red planet (Scribe, 2005) is well worth tracking down. A passionate insight into the  2004 twin rover Spirit and Opportunity mission by Steve Squyres, the mission&#8217;s scientific principal investigator.These robotic missions are prudent preparatory steps to Aldrin provides and engaging overview of the technical, economic and political reasons for humanity to journey to Mars. It has been a self-professed vision of his since his return from the Moon. This books, though, represents Aldrin&#8217;s first attempt to put the whole of the puzzle, his Unified Space Vision, together in one place. For a more technical read on the settlement and exploration of Mars then Zubrin&#8217;s revised and updated The Case for Mars (Free press, 2011) and Marswalk One: first steps on a new planet (Praxis, 2005) by astronautical historian, writer and designers David Shayler, Andrew Salmon and Michael Shayler are also recommended. Mission to Mars though is a clarion call, essential reading for anyone interested in humanity&#8217;s next big step.This review was first published on dragonlaughing\n",

            "I had to think long and hard about what I wanted to write for my review.  The author makes a point several times in her book to say that it is easier to criticize then be uplifting and happy.However I will start with a little criticism and finish with happy.  I found that author to be a generally negative person who portrays herself as someone who snaps at people a lot of generally has a negative, or critical attitude.  Those things really put me off from the book and at times I wondered why I was punishing myself to finish the book.However I did glean several things from it:1) a recommendation of the next book I want to read &#34;The Story of a Soul&#34;2) I learned that hugging for 6 seconds is the minimum to gain the positive effects from the action3) To remember that the years are short4) Enjoy the present5) Portraying yourself as happy can indeed make you happierI don't want to continue for it might spoil the rest of the book.I struggled with whether to say I would recommend this book.  Initially I would have said &#34;HECK NO&#34; but after completion I think there are plenty of people who can relate to her and take up some of her suggestions.  She can be a bit repetitive and can at times seem trite with the things she did...but this was HER project and these were things that she thought might make HER happy (I wouldn't need to copy them exactly myself just the spirit would need to be imitated).So I say yes I would recommend it but read it in small doses :)\n",

He is revealed as a down-to-earth, sometimes exacting man who pursued illumination from a young age. His single-minded devotion to his Inner Voice may have wavered sometimes, revealing that self-doubt is a necessary evil to awaken us to our human follies when we forget to trust implicitly. Joel Goldsmith was an extraordinary man whose life and message has stood the test of time; eschewing any formal organization to be established, he knew that his lessons and writings would be open to the interpretation of those following him, and that ego, that ever-present, demanding part of ourselves is too easily swayed by the need for praise and glorification. For this reason, his teachings are as vital today as when they were first presented, and remain undiluted Truths and a profound way for us to achieve Grace.\n",

Even then, the plot didn't really go anywhere deep - just a glimpse inside a few of the cupboards, an entrance of a villain, with the end of the book coming on too quickly with a unsatisfying conclusion. Yet, the characters are endearing (especially Uncle Frank). This is definitely a cliff-hanger book. It kept me interested enough to want to continue with the series, but I could only give it 4 stars because I felt that book should have been longer to include more story or the action could have developed sooner.\n",

Outsiders and characters who aren't a part of one group or another, but come together to make their own place. Sometimes they follow the law, most of the time they skirt it...a bit. Kali is focused and gets distracted by her inventions. She's independent and isn't completely comfortable dealing with people in any way other than snark. Pair her up with a sword-wielding, gun-touting man oozing mystery and carrying a grudge, explosions, some longstanding nemeses, a dash of romance and a teensy bit of magic and you have a Buroker-themed good time. Lots of fun. I appreciate that the characters aren't overly noble. It lends a scrappy honesty to their actions. Looking forward to seeing more of Kali and Cedar!\n",

            "I love a dark mystery, but the construction of the plot and the weak characters kept me from enjoying this book.Obstensibly, this is the story of a detective who is investigating a series of asphyxiation murders.  The targets are beautiful young women.  However, the decective does very little investigation.  He attends a couple of autopsies, but we don't get to see any of the sleuthing that is the usual hallmark of the genre.  If he investigates anything about the women's lives of what they have in common, readers never find out.  Instead we have a bit of &#34;Keystone Kops&#34; style detecting courtesy of a computer dating magnate and his IT man (they determine that the young women were all clients and try to determine who the killer is before the news gets out and wrecks their bottom line).  The detective spends most of his time worried about his personal life and none of his interactions seem particularly authentic.  And the way the author wraps up the plotline about his personal life left me scratching my head.Despite the fact that the author introduces us to a woman who is, presumably, a future victim of the killer, there is no real suspense or thrills here.  There are too many characters and their charactization is shoddy.  We don't care about the detective, we don't care about the dead women, we don't care about the rich man, we don't care about the coroner, we don't care about the potential victim -- every time I thought I'd run out of people to not care about, Hudson introduced another character.  The tension in their lives (cheating spouses, angry bosses, drunk drivers, etc) never comes into focus.It seems as if the investigation portion of the novel is so uneven because Hudson might not understand that much about investigation and killing, a serious issue in a serial killer procedural.  At one point, we're told by a supposed expert that the reason why the killer creates such elaborate asphyxiation scenarios for his victims is because he mistakenly believes it will heighten their sexual pleasure.  Given the amount of sexual and physical abuse the victims sustain and the fact that we're told he repeatedly revives them prior to finally letting them die, I think it is far more likely that the killer was a sadism, determined to bring his victims pain -- not pleasure.  Errors like this can be quite jarring and made me feel like I was reading an underresearched book.\n",

For someone to sell themselves so cheaply was just annoying.Maybe I am just used to the straight laced virgin historical girl.  Maybe I am wrapped a little too tight.  Maybe with the knowledge I have with the MC clubs I know most girls are hands off.  Which is why one man (Enforcer)  is assigned to me whenever we were at an event. I cant even go to the bathroom alone.Some of the sex scenes were great. I was horrified when she was tied up and basically raped but loved every minute of it.  For a H to be \"in love\" with a man and so openly spread her legs like peanut butter for another kind of blew the book for me.  Did her man not think her a whore after witnessing her foursome?

            "Despite the glowing reviews, I've put off reading this book because I wasn't impressed with the previous books I've read by James. Luckily, I was able to check it out from the library. It's fantastic! I require logic and linear progression of events in order to enjoy a story, and based on the two other books by James which I've read, I picture James as a free spirited, lively person who approaches writing in a joyful though haphazard way. I could be totally wrong, but that's the impression I got. Anyway, there's absolutely nothing haphazard about this book! It's lovely, and the tone and feel actually reminds me of Loretta Chase's belovedLord of Scoundrels.India's an interesting and extremely appealing heroine, along the lines of Sophy in Heyer'sThe Grand Sophy. Her career as a decorator and life organizer to the wealthiest families felt original and was presented in a very convincing manner, with her godmother Adelaide by her side as a chaperone and companion. I love that India charges exorbitant fees to make sure her services are valued and she's treated with respect - so true! Thorn is a typical alpha-male hero, though his childhood spent as a mudlark is interesting and he puts this skill to use in the climax of the story. His protective and loving relationship with Rose and memories of his younger siblings are very endearing.*** Spoiler *** I wish India and Thorn hadn't consummated their relationship prior to Thorn declaring himself. They mutually decide to have sex while Thorn declares he will not marry her and intends to marry Lala. Yuck! That is very hard for me to relate to - why would a woman give herself to a man who clearly and vocally prefers another person? Oh well, this is not an unusual plot device in Regency books, just one that I don't prefer to read. At least India didn't sit around lamenting her actions and was prepared to move on - I could admire her resolve and strength.  *** End Spoiler ***Overall outstanding book that I would read again. 4.5 stars, minus half star for what I stated in my spoiler.\n",

            "While this is deemed to be the last of the trilogy, it is alluded to that there could be more of Ana and Christian's adventures to come.  The Author leaves us with this tease.  This was a fitting ending to the rise and fall pattern of the series so far.  While the Grey's have each fought their own daemons and each others too they find a common one in the last book.  As expected it is not smooth sailing and happy ever after-there is more drama and more adventure to be found.  This series could easily be considered contrived and superficial due to the extremes that are through out the book: horrific childhood, loss of family, brokenness on multiple levels, extreme wealth with what appears extreme ease, insecurity, fear, stalking and self-worth issues that would keep Freud busy for lifetimes.  However, for me, the characters were most often relatable and dealing in a realistic-for them-way that worked.  I have loved this trilogy and have re-read it twice already.\n",

            "R.A. Salvatore has exceeded reasonable expectations with this episode in the continuing saga of Drizzt Do&#8217;Urden &#8211; gifting fantasy fans with a page-turning sword and sorcery adventure that is full of swashbuckling action, shadowy intrigue, and amazing character development.  Honestly, this new and improved version of the Companions of the Hall is a compelling read and might be the beginning of a renaissance for The Legend of Drizzt Do&#8217;Urden, breathing fresh life into old characters who have been desperately missed by the dark elf as well as by his many fans.As frequent readers will already know, in The Companions, Mr. Salvatore resurrected Drizzt&#8217;s old friends, The Companions of the Hall, but did not raise them from the grave.  Instead, Bruenor, Catt-brie, Regis, and Wulfgar were reborn into the world as newborn babies.  Unlike normal children, however, these four retained all of their memories from their past life and were fully aware of who they were the moment they opened their eyes. From this point, Mr. Salvatore did an outstanding job of weaving an intriguing tale of the first twenty-one years of Bruenor, Catt-brie, and Regis&#8217; lives as they grew to adulthood, developed new talents and slowly evolved into similar yet different people.  But no matter their new personas, each of the Companions inevitably wove their way through life and its innumerable obstacles to met again in Icewind Dale on a certain day at a certain spot when their old companion Drizzt was in desperate need of their assistance.Night of the Hunter picks up immediately after the events in The Companions. Now reunited, the Companions of the Hall must see if their former friendship has survived Bruenor, Catt-brie, Regis, and Wulfgar&#8217;s resurrection.  Naturally, there are issues. A second chance at life has changed Drizzt&#8217;s old friends in many ways.  Things that they once agreed upon so easily are now objects of contention. Internal struggles ensue, as Bruenor and Catt-brie decide that their goddess-given rebirth is an opportunity for them to rectify previous mistakes.  Mistakes that Drizzt himself still views as the proper course, and so the dark elf finds himself being forced to look long and hard at whether many of his dearly held truths about life might be wrong, and quickly, it begins to look like these old friends could split apart over what their new mission in the world should be.  Before things get too heated, however, one task is mentioned that all can agree upon: the rescue of their old friend Thibbledorf Pwent from his haunted existence as a vampire in the halls of ancient Gauntlygrim, and so our heroes head out into the world for a new adventure.  Their differences set aside for the moment &#8211; but not forgotten.From this point, the story divides off into several different plots and main characters.  Naturally, the primary story line follows Drizzt and the Companions as they travel the lands, heading for Gauntlygrim and then arriving, but substantial portions of the book are also given over to Drizzt&#8217;s former band of adventurers (headed now by Artemis Entreri and Dahlia) as well as the drow, specifically the activities of Matron Mother Baenre.  And for the remainder of the novel, Mr. Salvatore shifts perspective from one group to another, spinning an ambitious tale of reunion (The Companions), lose (Entreri/Dahlia&#8217;s group), and machination (The drow).  With all three stories going on at once, a reader is hard pressed to keep everything straight in his mind, but Mr. Salvatore has always had a knack for juggling numerous plot threads, and he does an admirable job here of having each cast of characters act independently but keep their stories intertwined just enough that they all are obviously moving toward a dramatic collision.Overall, this book was an action-packed, sword and sorcery adventure tale that mixed in enough character interaction and diabolical, drow intrigue to keep my attention.  My only criticism &#8211; minor though it will sound &#8211; is that there is so much going on in Night of the Hunter that much of the plot seemed a bit rushed, as if Mr. Salvatore could have easily added in another volume to this latest chapter in Drizzt&#8217;s story.  Other than this one issue though, I highly recommend this novel to all Drizzt fans or lovers of entertaining sword and sorcery tales, and while the promised climax of the story does not occur in Night of the Hunter, it is set up very nicely, leaving a Drizzt fan salivating for the war between drow, orcs, dwarves, and elves that is sure to follow in succeeding novels.I received this book from Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review.  I&#8217;d like to thank Netgalley and Wizards of the Coast for allowing me to receive this review copy and inform everyone that the review you have read is my opinion alone.\n",

            "We think of Pompeii as frozen in the year 79 A.D., and maybe it was indeed inert until people started digging around the site in the eighteenth century.  From then on, the place has inevitably changed, as people dug in it and restored it to their way of thinking, fantasized about it, took parts of it away, and made it fit for the thousands of visitors who came to wander its streets.  It is this story that is told in _From Pompeii: The Afterlife of a Roman Town_ (Belknap/Harvard) by Ingrid D. Rowland.  The author is a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Rome, and her chapters are essays on aspects of the city.  Some of them are personal, like her memories of being taken to the area when she was a child (there is a picture here of her as an eight-year-old in Herculaneum, with a Brownie camera dangling from her neck) or her experiences in taking commercial tours from Rome to the region where she has conducted more serious academic tours.  While the chapters are chronological, Rowland is a digressive and often witty writer, who obviously enjoys relating facts in a more informal way (nonetheless, there are plenty of footnotes).  &#8220;This book presents a selection of visitors whose lives were forever altered by their experience of Pompeii, as well as a few who reacted less drastically.&#8221;  While there are plenty of references to the city, its history, and its archaeology, the story of its afterlife proves to be colorful, frustrating, and funny.Pompeii&#8217;s discovery came after Herculaneum was being dug up, and by 1765 tour guides had added Pompeii to their repertoires for people coming to see the region around Naples.  Much of Rowland&#8217;s book has to do with visits to Pompeii by famous people.  The fifteen-year-old Mozart went in 1770, and it is often said that Mozart&#8217;s visit to the site, especially the Temple of Isis, helped inspire parts of _The Magic Flute_.  But Rowland admits, &#8220;How exactly are we to recognize the reflection of an archaeological site in a musical composition?&#8221;  Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#8217;s novel _The Last Days of Pompeii_ has characters say things like, &#8220;Ho, Diomed, well met!  Do you sup with Glaucus to-night?&#8221;  The 1867 novel, which seems to insert Victorian speech and views into the doomed city, was a bestseller, and it used to be (seriously) recommended for those who were making their first visit to view the ruins.  Dickens visited in 1845, and wrote a description in _Pictures of Italy_ which movingly could describe the ruins as we see them even now.  He was moved by imagining all those Pompeians wiped out by Vesuvius, but he was disturbed by the Neapolitan cult of the dead.  Mark Twain visited in 1875, and in _Innocents Abroad_ wrote acerbically about the Neapolitan belief in the miraculous liquefaction of the blood of San Gennaro which helped draw money from onlookers (he&#8217;d chuckle to know that the blood is still performing this function).  Like Dickens, he was more moved by the ruins of Pompeii itself, and he was inspired by the figure of the &#8220;Steadfast Soldier,&#8221; a guard whose skeleton was found in his guard-box, refusing to abandon his post just because a volcano was raging.  Many other moralists at the time admired the Steadfast Soldier; there is, however, no evidence that the skeleton was any more than some unfortunate Pompeian, fleeing with all the others, who ducked under an arch, not into a guard-box, for shelter.  Pierre-Auguste Renoir visited Italy in 1881 after struggling in Paris for twenty years, and was inspired by the classical paintings he saw and by the light.  He admired the frescoes from Pompeii that he saw in the National Museum in Naples and on site.  His paintings became brighter and more sculptural because of them.  In 1994, Hillary Clinton refused to be satisfied with seeing just Herculaneum, and got into Pompeii, although her tour was abbreviated.  Secret Service agents went before her room by room to make sure everything was safe, and their protectiveness extended to preventing her from entering a room in the beautiful House of the Vettii where there is a famous statue of the god Priapus with his enormous phallus.  This was not going to be a photo op.In Rowland&#8217;s vivid telling, Pompeii proves to be a very lively place indeed.  And still the ancient streets are alive with guides and tourists.  Buying and selling and arguing go on nearby, just as they did two thousand years ago.  The other constant is Mount Vesuvius, which is now overdue for an eruption, and it is quite possible that the whole place will be buried again, along with much of the the surrounding area along the Bay of Naples.  The Neapolitans are skeptical about government, and there is every reason to believe that any evacuation plan, even with scientific warnings the ancient Pompeians never had, is going to leave thousands behind when the volcano blows.  &#8220;There is simply no way to escape the discrepancy of scale between Vesuvius and human beings,&#8221; writes Rowland.  &#8220;It is one of the reasons that Pompeii pulls so on our imagination.&#8221;\n",

            "I have read all four of Dirk Hayhurst's books now and have enjoyed each one of them. Where the first three predominately focused on the lighter side of baseball (with terrific background into his troubled family, his supportive romance and subsequent marriage), &#34;Bigger Than the Game&#34; takes a slightly different tack. Dirk gets injured and his experiences move to the trials and tribulations of dealing with rehab, teammates resentful of his writing, and the realization that what makes one good on the field of competition is not necessarily what gives one an acceptable quality of life.Dirk Hayhurst's writing is vulnerable and real. We are privy to the rarely seen shadow world of pro sports rehabbing and psychologists. A particularly funny section of the book takes place at the world famous Andrews Clinic in Birmingham, where Hayhurst encounters sadistic trainers, a baseball crazy nun, a living ghost of the old south, and wrestler Triple H.The world of the injured player can be a difficult one. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think being lonely has anything to do with the number of people you&#8217;re around,&#8221; writes Hayhurst. Largely separated from the team during their physical rehab regimen, players are suddenly removed from the game they have devoted their lives to from an early age. With time suddenly on their hands basic insecurities often rise and introspection follows. Some cannot handle it. Some become depressed and turn to pain meds, some turn to alcohol, and some face difficult home lives. &#8220;Spring training for the injured is like detention. While everyone else is out having fun, sharing experiences in the game they love, you&#8217;re stuck inside doing tedious busywork.&#8221; While teams now often provide a sports psychologist to help players work through these problems, actually going to see one is seen as a sign of weakness by many in the game.Hayhurst finally does go to the psychologist, albeit reluctantly, and works to come to terms with his difficulties. Professional sports is a business, and as a business it is performance based. &#8220;It&#8217;s like this,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;This whole industry is morally bankrupt. It&#8217;s full of fakes and bastards and arrogant SOBs who can get away with murder as long as they play great. And then, on the flip side, there&#8217;s a pocket of decent guys who deserve respect, but don&#8217;t get it if they don&#8217;t play well&#8230;but instead of trying to say we&#8217;re not a commodity, we just want to be the most valuable commodity possible&#8230;both sides say they hate it and yet both sides wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.&#8221; Later, when he talks to wrestler Triple H at the Andrews Clinic, Hayhurst realizes that playing a sport professionally is &#8220;a job where people look at the role you play on television and feel they have the right to make up what your life should be like.&#8221;If, as Yogi Berra said, 90 percent of baseball is half mental, the mental side of the game is much underrepresented in print. Players have to learn not only how to play the game, but how to play a role when they reach the elite levels of their sport. Many struggle off the field with this distinction, with disastrous results plucked right from today's headlines. Hayhurst encounters all of these issues and more. Instead of succumbing to his problems, he uses the time to step away from the intense competition of sport and get some much-needed perspective. &#8220;&#8230;at the end of the day, we were just grown men putting on costumes and playing children&#8217;s games. To take any of it more seriously than that was a mistake.&#8221; The money, competition, intensity and constant press coverage seems to warp perspectives and values in sports in a way that makes people glorify the game and forget that there are other things that are more important. Players coddled from a young age because of their athletic abilities often forget that there is much more out there that is bigger than the game.Dirk Hayhurst gives us a rare and fascinating behind the scenes glimpse of broken athletes working out of the spotlight not just to return to form, but to discover and face what it really is to be human. &#8220;You know,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;I think I learned more about baseball this year than any season before it, and I didn't throw a single pitch.&#8221;\n",

Pippa&#8217;s beauty rendered Lucas completely speechless and is only response to her introduction was to turn around and leave without saying a word to her. While he didn&#8217;t say anything to her that didn&#8217;t mean that she was far from his thoughts. Months after meeting Pippa, Lucas has decided that he wants to marry her. He doesn&#8217;t see any reason why she would object so proceeds with plans for their engagement ball.  When Lucas arrives at Pippa&#8217;s house and tells her that they will be married, he is unprepared for her answer. For whoever says No to a duke! Pippa Welby does and she puts up one heck of a fight!I found Pippa to be a charming young woman that knows what she wants in a relationship and is willing to fight for that. I loved how she tried to rid herself of an unwanted husband it made for some hilarious moments in the story. While she has ten days to she realizes that maybe Lucas isn&#8217;t as bad as she originally thought. But what happens when the original reason Lucas decided to marry her comes to light&#8230;can she trust him and even love him still?Lucas is everything you could want in a Duke, handsome and a little arrogant. He is used to getting what he wants and he wants Pippa. When Pippa turns him down he knows that he has a fight on his hands. The more time he spends with her he comes to care for her and his original reason for marrying her is secondary to how much he loves her.I really enjoyed this story and found myself smiling the entire time I was reading it. It was beautifully written with really great characters. I can&#8217;t wait to read more from this author.\n",

            "I had heard a lot about this book, so I decided to take a detour and read it.  With as many erotic novels as I have read, I have never read one from the gentleman's point of view.  I found myself having to remember that this was the man speaking, and not the woman.  This was a very enjoyable read.  I didn't quite know what to expect.  It was indeed, as the title says, an interview.  I guess I expected the usual girl interviews Master, girl falls in love with Master, Master makes her his latest submissive.  Master falls in love with submissive, against his better judgment and they live happily ever after.  This was not the typical story in the least.  I was a bit heart broken in the end and shocked by what was happening to this relationship.  I'm one-clicking the next installment, despite the controversy regarding the second book's ending and the spoilers that have been leaked.  Jason Luke is a superb writer and I like to read a book and make my own opinions about it.  Great job, Sir.\n",

            "First off, is this book destined to become a classic like &#34;The Count Of Monte Cristo&#34;? Probably not.But, what it is, is a well-written, fun story and a continuation of the smaller plot-points in the original. &#34;Sultan of Monte Cristo&#34; follows the Count of Monte Cristo as he becomes the Sultan of Albania (after channeling his inner pirate as Sinbad) and is slowly dealing with the repercussions of his actions in &#34;Count&#34;. Initially worried that the book might take on a &#34;fan-fiction&#34; tone, style, and quality,  I was glad that the book was-well-written, with a tone and style of a professional author, and a well-fleshed-out and -though-out story which I considered high quality. It was obvious from reading it that &#34;Sultan&#34; came from a place of love for the original. I enjoyed reading it, and it was a rather quick read as well, being only about 100 pages.

While this is a M/M love story - its just THAT - one of the best love stories I've ever read.  The world she's designed is creative, unique, intriguing and suspenseful!  I'm an Utopian kinda girl, so wasn't sure I could &#34;do&#34; M/M dystopian future - but my heart was pulled straight into this story - and the story is fantastic! I haven't cried from reading a book in a long time - but I cried 2 or 3 times in this story, and its not pointless angst, just to rip your heart out, its LOVE - its fighting for everything you want despite impossible odds, its impossible love and what that journey would be like for those not willing to ever give up!Some of you read so much erotic romance - its starting to get a bit stale...you know what I mean, you're looking for something FRESH.  Reading this M/M love story serves up a different flavor, different flare of romance, whats arousing and erotic to men - real men!  Not trashy, or pornographic at all in my opinion. You will be so pleasantly surprised - and so hotly anxious to read more of her work!  This is a serious attention grabbing debut book from a very talented, funny, beautiful, down to earth, southern girl. I look forward to so much more from RIE, and you should too!

Those crazy stunts you pulled or the stupid pictures of yourself getting a tidbit drunk or going crazy at a party may come back to haunt you.People don't think to look on the Internet much to find out what others are saying about them.  They don't realize that their Facebook page can become a detriment to them when Employers or Graduate Schools start to look into the person applying to join them.  Yes, don't think they don't look they do.So, is personal branding so abhorrent to you that you don't think about it.  I felt that way.  But I think anyone searching today for a job or looking to further their career needs to think about it.This is not about lying about yourself and putting a good face on things.

Ultimately though, I did truly enjoy reading this book and there were some turns of phrase and questions he posed that I just couldn't shake (in a good way).

I really didn't know what the book was about but it was looking forward to getting my hands on it. I was not disappointed when I was gifted a copy from Arden Aoide ( HUGE thanks to you lady I want MORE now!!) Every Girl dreams of her wedding and wants to look her best, not Shula she wanted to show everyone how much she didn't want this wedding. See arranged marriages would be hard for anyone but knowing that your mother killed herself to save you from this arranged marriage really makes you not want it. Shula goes the extreme to show it why should she care, she plans on killing herself. But then at the wedding something happens and it makes the arranged marriage more tolerable. I am sucked into this world, it had to beginning of love, resent, plotting and murder it in. I can't wait to see whats next and what it was Shula's mother knew. I just know there's a lot of this story that had to deal with what she knew and why she killed herself. I believe fans of Arden's fans will not be disappointed in A Consummation. But I believe this will bring her more fans, and I am very excited to see where this series will take her.I was very lucky to be gifted with a copy for this review.

On example:  a character is accused of a shooting murder, but apparently no one things to check her for gun shot residue, which might have provided very important evidence.  Another &#34;lack&#34;' that troubled me was that the cops responsible for investigating each of two different crimes seemed not to be investigating at all, just choosing a convenient suspect (I know, that is probably true-to-life, but still...).  As usual, Annika herself is sometimes annoying and never very likeable, and her husband Thomas is worse.  Despite these limitations, I enjoyed the story enough to read the next one.\n",

Shipping stuff by sea has become incredibly cheap, and the quality of life on board container ships has suffered as their owners have looked to cut costs as much as possible.This is combined with the unethical but totally legal practice of choosing your own country of origin (with most companies choosing the ones with the least cost and/or oversight), which leaves the crew at the mercy of uncaring legal systems when they're stiffed by their employers.Turnaround times while in port have shortened to less than a day, meaning that shore leave is short when the crew gets any at all.  Maersk (and other companies) forbids families (due to piracy), drinking (for obvious reasons), and plenty of other things that would make a seafaring life less monotonous.I knew most of this before reading the book, but I was happy to see it fleshed out.If I enjoyed the book, why'd I give it three stars?  The content felt padded out.  The journey itself could have been a long article.  The piracy chapter was way too long, as were some of the other non-narrative portions of the book.

However, The One and Only is just awful. First, I understand that football is a character in the book but I feel she relies on it too much in lieu of developing her characters on a deeper level. I got bogged down by the endless amount of football statistics and discussion. The characters just didn't grab me and I found them difficult to relate with. Second, I was really hoping Shea wasn't going to develop a romantic relationship with the coach but it went there. If it weren't for the fact that they were like &#34;family&#34; and he was a father figure to her and messages of that nature were heavily emphasized early on, it would not have been bothersome. But the whole thing just felt very inscestual and VERY, VERY creepy. The main character has deep psychological issues regarding her relationships with men. I felt myself analyzing that throughout the book. It definitly is not a book I would suggest reading. Read a case study on the Electra complex instead.\n",

            "Crash Gordon and the Revelations from Big Sur certainly has a wide array of colorful characters if nothing else. I think every kind is hit here. Derek did a great job of mixing the many personalities into the story and they all have their own distinct voice. Not only that but the work in of some of life's conspiracies and a mix of explanations/theories, really propels the story from start to finish.The first person narrative was an interesting change of pace from most novels I've read of late. It does let the reader get a sense of the inner workings throughout but the perspectives shift at times such as in the prologue, which can get a bit confusing unless you are really paying attention. Also well I liked the little added cliff notes in parentheses&#8202;, I'm not sure they were needed every time.The descriptors are surely top notch and not much is held back, so if you can get offended by language or images that will surely pop in your head, it may not be for you.But other than that it was clear there was a plan from the very beginning. You won't be left out in the cold with a lackluster ending, which so many books fail on. Crash Gordon and the Revelations from Big Sur provides a satisfying ending, that makes the trip there all the more enjoyable.With sex cults, alien abductions, and even a foul mouthed radio DJ, there is something here for everyone. The images throughout are also a nice touch.\n",

            "Children are our most precious responsibility and yet as a stay at home mom, I was amazed how many people tried to pawn their children off on me every chance they got.  I was considered a &#34;good mom&#34; and we had a &#34;good family&#34;.  We were white, middle class professional background and people never looked beyond what they saw.  I came from a not so safe background and I always thought to myself, &#34;How do these people know I'm not an axe murderer.&#34;  This book deals with not only the kidnapping and theft by a con artist met through Facebook, but the falling apart of a marriage through hubris and failed expectations.Lately I seem to be reading a lot of stories that center around men who allow their vanities free will by entering into elaborate fantasy flirtations to outright affairs instead of being honest and trying to fix what is wrong with their relationships.  Tommy is an English, Oxford educated computer programmer married to a naive well off Princess named Sylvia.  She is four years older than Tommy who came from a lower class background.  Tommy hits a mid-life crisis early and they decide to move to Wyoming and sell their New York apartment to raise their adopted daughter Grace in a better place.  They do not visit the place in winter and they find they sunk all their money into a pit they can't sell.  They need help from her father and their marriage starts to slide.  Tommy starts flirting with a 20 year old wanna be actress/model.  He constantly Facebooks her which is making his wife despair.  Her Dad dies and Tommy is in LA for a job interview for a job that won't pay for a good life in LA.  He has another lunch plus we don't actually know with the little user he is in fantasy with and is not able to be reached when his wife calls him.  Her father has overdosed on his sleeping pills and she needs to leave to try to reach him before he dies.  There is only one seat on one flight available to get her there.  Ruth, her writer Facebook friend, is there to visit Sylvia and she and Tommy convince her to go.  Tommy gets a ticket for talking and driving on a cell phone and misses his flight back and when he arrives a day later, Ruth has stolen his daughter and his wife's inheritance.  She dyed her hair and took Grace and disappeared after she stole the money.Tommy had lied that he had a job in LA that would make a lot of money in a short time and coincidentally met the 20 year old shortly after landing.  Tommy takes off to try to find Grace leaving Sylvia to talk to the FBI and post films of Grace on You Tube and using Lonely Planet to try to find Ruth in the wilds of Central America and South America.  He once again shuts Sylvia out of the process making her feel useless.  He finds Ruth in the Copacabana where she was staying with his wife's money recovering from plastic surgery.  She steals his iPhone after feeling him up and gets out without paying leaving the iPhone and a cheery note for Sylvia.I am parsing the book at this point so I will see how it ends.  It has moments of lyricism if you can work your way through the plot and the unbelievable characters.  I love Grace, but I am having a hard time caring about anybody other that Jacqueline, the maid who helped bring Sylvia up and provides guidance and comfort.This book just does not work for me despite the good reviews that are not posted by verified buyers.  The idea of having your child stolen is a frightening one that would have worked better if the main characters had not acted so stupidly.  They need to grow up and the idea of living in an area with a small child where you do not know someone local well enough to leave your child with in an emergency is not a logical one.  Anyone who left their child with someone they met over the internet is seriously damaged.  A more believable plot device would have made the immaturity of the three main characters less glaring.\n",

I must admit I'd like to smack James up side the head for his density regarding dealing with Elise....... he just doesn't seem to get how to make it all right.  Oh well..... Elise soldiers on anyways.  Definitely read this series from the beginning...... in fact, read the whole Descent Series first.  I've spent a couple of weeks enjoying this new world and am really looking forward to the next installment.\n",

It is of course very old fashioned, but there are lots of life lessons here and a wonderful portrait of World War II lives of some amazing women.  We always hear about the military men but this is about civilian women and children in Europe and their heroic behaviors and tragedies.\n",

No one has ever given us such an insight into the pain she suffered at the hands of her parents.....being cold and totally unsupportative of her.  She did so much in her short career and is often overlooked as an Academy Award winning actress.  I totally enjoyed this book by Donald Spoto and learned all of Princess Grace's contributions not only in her pictures, but in her life as the Princess of Monaco.  As a little girl, I loved her movies and found this book to be utterly informative, well-written and charming.\n",

            "Erika Ashby has outdone herself with this book.  I have read all her previous works, but this one is by far her best.I was blown away by the story and the myriad of emotions that it evokes.  One piece of advice though, DO NOT READ WHILE AT WORK!!!  There is a slight chance that people might look at you funny when they see you crying your eyes out ;-)I fell in love with this wonderful trio; Lynsie and Lincoln, the perfect married couple, and Dax, their best friend, whom they can always count on.  When tragedy strikes and Lynsie finds her world in shambles, Dax steps in to help her pick up the pieces.  It is so heartbreaking to live through the pain right along with her, but also very heartwarming to see her growth and healing.  The relationship that blossoms from this tragedy is so amazing and you get to experience the confusion and butterflies that the characters are feeling.The story is so well written and the character development goes at just the perfect pace.To say that I loved this story and these characters is an understatement.Broken Wings is a book that should be in everyone's hands.\n",

With a cute title I was expecting a cutesy romance, and while I got what I was expecting; I never imagined that I would be in tears from the very first page!!We start with Caleb saying his final goodbye to his wife, and I just knew that I wouldn't be able to walk away from this book!Abby is a kindergarten teacher and Caleb's little girl Madison is in her class, so they meet right off the bat. Mind you it has been four years since the wife's passing. Things are weird between them at first because they are both trying to fight their attraction to the other, while friends and family are scheming to hook them up!All the characters were well written and I found myself rooting for Abby, Caleb and sweet little Madison from the get go.

And Jackson works really hard to prove her wrong, and he won't give up on her either. These two start to heat up pretty quickly and enjoy a beautiful relationship.I really liked this book. I thought it was really good. The writing was good, and the plot just sucks you in from the start! Then you enjoy an awesome ride of a woman finding out things about herself as well as finding a new man. However the book did seem somewhat short I still enjoyed it. And now I look forward to reading more in this series. It just needed a little bit more action in my opinion and it would have been better than good! I really loved all of the characters, and it was also awesome to have one of the main characters a twin!(Especially if he's a hot guy) So now I'm off to read the next book.

            "This is not a perfect book, but it flows into the world of Kate Daniels so well and has a couple twists I didn't see coming. I am a little torn over the obligatory fight Kate and Curran have near the end of the book (well, the frustrated falling-out that they have through the second half of the book that culminates in a real I'm-leaving-you-the-hell-you-are kind of fight). On the one hand, do they have to have essentially the same misunderstanding/doubting our love-fest every book? On the other, Curran did act like a patronizing ass. I think Kate let him off too easy for that, however, given that he does sort of redeem himself and they do work so well together, I guess I can make do.The best part of this book was all the character development going on. No one does characters like Ilona Andrews; even her secondary characters are all well fleshed out and fascinating in their strengths and weaknesses.  Doolittle's ferocity and fear, for example, was great to see. The little side drama of Aunt B, Andrea, and Raphael was heartbreaking and completely understandable. Even the obnoxious pregnant woman who could so easily have been nothing more than a plot device ended up being kind of a cool character.\n",

            "Harriet Burden, the protagonist of this novel, frustrated by the inability of a female artist to gain the exposure or respect accorded to men, collaborates in turn with three male artists willing to exhibit her work as theirs. Although there are common themes in all three exhibits, their styles are radically different, changing with each mask that Burden puts on. I found this interesting, since the three books by Siri Hustvedt that I have read (WHAT I LOVED,THE SUMMER WITHOUT MEN, and this), while also sharing similar themes, are so different in texture and approach as to present quite different facets of their author. WHAT I LOVED inhabits the art world as brilliantly as this new book does, but it is full of characters that you care about as human beings, and is built around a linear story that keeps you reading. THE SUMMER WITHOUT MEN, the weakest of these three books, is basically a justified feminist lament centered around a character who is difficult to like, and told more or less in scrapbook form, though with flashes of real brilliance.And this one? First of all, it is as tightly engineered intellectually as a BMW. Although it continues some of the scrapbook approach of SUMMER, being a collection of statements, cuttings, and journal entries illuminating the last decade of Burden's career, it has none of the random feel of its predecessor. The \"Editor's Introduction\" immediately introduces an atmosphere of scholarly rigor, footnoted with references to writers, artists, and thinkers who, whether famous or obscure, all seem to be real. Harriet Burden's range of knowledge (and therefore by rather too obvious implication that of her creator) is phenomenal. A very small selection of the names referenced in her book might include: Margaret Cavendish, Edmund Husserl, Sren Kierkegaard, Tertullian, and Aby Warburg. These are just some of the names I happen to recognize, but the list of those I don't is inexhaustible: Gallese, Gassendi, Manturana, Metzinger, Varela, Zahavi.... Every reference that I followed up turns out to be the genuine article, so I assume they all are, but I do get the feeling that part of Hustvedt's reason for writing is to display everything she knows, and wow it's a lot! I was blown away... but not drawn in.About art, Hustvedt writes well, as she always has. It is interesting that when artists are mentioned in modern fiction, they are almost always conceptual artists or the makers of installations -- probably because such art is much easier to convey in words. The last major novels I recall whose protagonists are actual painters areMY NAME IS ASHER LEVby Chaim Potok andTHE UNDERPAINTERby Jane Urquhart. But inA MAP OF GLASS, Urquhart turned to sculptors and environmental artists. Bill Wechsler, the leading artist in Hustvedt's WHAT I LOVED (also referenced here) begins as a painter, but turns to constructions. And both artists in Claire Messud's recentTHE WOMAN UPSTAIRS-- a novel with remarkable similarities to this one, and I think the more successful of the two -- are engaged in making environments that develop feminist themes.As does Harriet Burden: everything ranging from doll-houses through soft sculptures to room-filling labyrinths. Her first \"mask\" collaboration is a piece called \"The History of Western Art,\" in which a huge sculpture based on a Titian nude is pasted all over with witty references to women over the past 600 years of art. Her second, \"Suffocation Rooms,\" is a series of kitchens where the furniture gradually gets larger and the temperature hotter. Her third, \"Beneath,\" a collaboration with a neo-Warhol media star known only as Rune, is an oblique response to 9/11, in which the viewer penetrates a maze of distorted passages pierced with windows and peepholes giving onto disturbing sights. If there is a conventional plot in the novel at all, it is the mystery of why the collaboration with Rune went so very wrong, and possibly contributed to the death of both artists. [All the above, incidentally, are facts that we learn from the introduction.]When I started this review, I was sure I was going to give the book a five-star rating, if only for its intellectual density and the fascination of its multi-voiced approach. But as I write, I realize that while these things can intrigue or amuse me, they do not make me care about the people. I miss the plot of WHAT I LOVED, and Oh how I miss the characters! After reading 360 pages by and about Harriet Burden, I still don't feel I know her. I sympathize with her plight, yes -- most of what Hustvedt says about women's issues is spot on -- but that is very different from caring about her as a person. And while there is much of interest in the story of the failings of Harriet's parents and her late husband (a wealthy art dealer), or perhaps her own as a mother, there is simply too much there -- together with musings on sexuality and a dozen other topics. I just feel that on the emotional and thematic planes Hustvedt is trying to repeat what she does in the intellectual sphere -- cramming in a lot of everything, but leaving little for the reader to embrace. So those five stars for effort must alas be rounded down.\n",

Addie was a strong and confident character while still suffering from amnesia over the events of that night when the Academy blew up.  A few of the character interactions were a little off, and I was confused by what some of the magical characters were all about (but I attribute that to my own lack of paranormal reading experience), but overall I found the story engaging enough to keep me up waaay past my bedtime.

            "Full review at ontopdownunderbookreviews.comThis book is not a gay romance. It is a powerful piece of LGBT fiction that happens to have a gay man as the narrator, and that gay man happens to have a partner. But the book is about so much more. The Shattered Door is about being beaten down psychologically, trying to be a good person, trying to believe in yourself, despite adversity, and maintain a relationship with God. It is about creating another family and not allowing someone who the MC was taught to love honour and obey from birth, no matter what, to have so much power. Our parents are deified by us, by the Ten Commandments, and by society. It is hard to break the need, the instruction to be a good child worthy of love, no matter our age, when it is impossible to do that with the parent(s) you have been given. That process is a complex one and Brandon Witt nailed it. It is also very much about religion and being a gay man trying to find himself, maintain his faith, when many have told him that it is a sin and an abomination. Others have linked being gay to being a paedophile. That he will 'go to Hell' has been preached at him for years, on top of a mother who backs it up in her own toxic way.If you are open to good writing, some parts that make you want to unleash your anger, that make you (want to) cry, that make you think, and make you glad that you did not grow up with Rose Morrison as your mother. If you want to read a book that brands you, then read the wonderful, painful, hopeful and heartfelt The Shattered Door.&#8220;You&#8217;ll be fine.  Assuming the church don&#8217;t catch fire or nothin&#8217; when you walk in with your blaze of gayness, that is.&#8221;&#8220;Maudra! Shhh!&#8221;  That was all I needed.

            "Quick hot read, super sexy but limited story. This is one of those quickie books that is all about the sex. I am sure this is somebodies fantasy, not so much mine. Still the smexy stuff is hautt!!! Might need to consider my own closet encounter!I listened to the audiobook narrated by Courtney Jones. She has a great pace and tone throughout the read. Personally, I think a male narrator would have been better. It just never reached quite the intensity the words called for. While she is fantastic on the book I need a sexy male voice to really make it hot.Disclosure - I received a copy in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts, opinions and ratings are my own.\n",

            "What an awesome book!! I really love this series.  This book is about Logan and Clare's wedding.  I had ugly tears running down my face as I read this book.  But, they were happy tears.  This is a happy book.  If you have read the other books in this series then you know the difficulties that Logan and Clare faced and are facing as they get married.  My heart was so happy for them.  With J. L. Berg's writing style, I felt as if I were part of the wedding party.  Plus, at the end of this book we get a peak at Declan and Leah's baby being born.  This is just a short story and you can finish quickly.  It is so worth the read.  Dual point of views.  Can't wait for the next book that comes out later this year.  J. L. Berg is an amazing writer.\n",

            "Six Suspects clearly shows the ability of the author in writing powerful scenes. But the structure of the book got in its way. It took almost four hundred pages to weave back to the point of the book and in the meantime it was a little confusing to remember the individual characters and how each of them fit into the whole. There were a little too many cliches for my liking and I was quite disappointed when my favorite character was murdered at the end ruining any hope that the one with the most integrity would triumph. I had to push my way through the last 75 pages -- get on with it already. This is not a defeat for the writer because each section was well-written except for some cliches that distracted me, but the problem with this book is the connection to its conclusion. So the writer's ability kept me reading but the story itself was sometimes a push. I'd still encourage people to read Six Suspects and decide for themselves.Jan Marquart Author and CEO and Founder of About the Author Network\n",

            "I was really excited for this book to come out but after reading it I have to say I was a little more then disappointed. I was looking forward to Trent's story because he is one of my favorite characters in the series. However, this whole book seemed like it was pulled together all too quickly. It didn't really flow, Cami's brothers were super aggressive and then it was like they dropped off the face of the earth. Her family issues were NEVER resolved. The ending was insanely rushed and all in all really not well written out. First of all, why in the world would TJ date Cami knowing Trenton loved her forever? Then when it finally came out who TJ was it was like nothing ever happened, BAM! everyone was happy and moved on. It honestly makes no sense. The only reason it got 3 stars was because of the short glimpses we got of Abby and Travis. I really hope Thomas's story isn't like this one :/ I really loved the BD series.\n",

            "Max and her &#8220;flock&#8221; are no normal group of kids. Far from it. They&#8217;ve been chased by various evil geniuses their whole lives, escaped from high security prisons, regained some sense of their identities and even found a place they could call home. If only those chasing them would stop, allowing them a well-deserved breather from continual pursuit.These aren&#8217;t just normal kids, though. These kids are what you&#8217;d call special. And I&#8217;m not talking about special in an oh-they-are-so-cute-and-adorable-and-well-behaved kind of way. This is a different kind of special. A superhero kind of special. Like having wings, and super sharp vision, gills for underwater excursions, and being able to disappear right in front of people, as well as having the ability to go all Jedi mind-tricky and manipulate any living being&#8217;s thoughts. And not to mention their extraordinary um&#8230;shall we say&#8230;fragrance. Not exactly abilities you&#8217;d expect for a normal, run-of-the-mill teenager. (Well, except for the extraordinary fragrance part.)And did I mention there&#8217;s also a talking, flying dog tagging along with the flock? Oh yeah&#8212;there&#8217;s one.Most people have normal days. They wake up, go to work or school, come home, relax, before heading off to bed so they can do it all again the next day. Not Max.Max&#8217;s normal day is like the nightmare of all nightmare days. A day of dread, filled with getting attacked by evil flesh-covered robot ninjas looking to go all martial artsy on your noggin, avoiding becoming a hot lunch for a monstrous sea creature, being kidnapped and threatened, chasing bad guys across an ocean to save a loved one, and trying to hold your family together, while remaining bullet hole free. It&#8217;s a tough gig. Try having that be your normal day.James Patterson does a stellar job of furthering the story of Max and her flock in the latest installment of the Maximum Ride series, Max. The novel delves deeper into each character&#8217;s background and personality, as well as into their awesome superpowers! Each character is expanded upon in the book, making the story even more addicting and engaging. The true highlight, though, is how Patterson finally throws Max headfirst into a romantic relationship, filled with oodles of delicious teenage bird-kid awkwardness. He does an incredible job of making Max and her efforts for love relatable to the reader. It&#8217;s great to finally see her have something all her own in her life. Something personal.Not only is the character development exemplary, but as always in a Maximum Ride novel, the action was non-stop, in-your-face, wow-I-haven&#8217;t-had-time-to-catch-my-breath intense. Written for a teens and tweens audience (but enjoyable for ANY age), the plot line is fast-paced, edge of your seat entertainment. The story never drags, never slows, rabbit-ing along to its stunning conclusion. Patterson writes the story from Max&#8217;s point-of-view, offering a fresh perspective, which lends itself to some very amusing one-liners that are interspersed perfectly between intense, nail-biting moments. It&#8217;s comic relief&#8212;Max style. And it&#8217;s awesome. There&#8217;s no way someone couldn&#8217;t fall in love with Max and her &#8220;flock.&#8221;Once again James Patterson has created an entertaining, lightning-fast paced story that I just could&#8217;t get enough of. Like literary apple pie. With two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. The only disappointment in the whole book: that there wasn&#8217;t even more to read! Max as well as the rest of the Maximum Ride series is wonderful for almost any age group and always rises to the occasion, each new installment seemingly better than the previous book. Once again Max rocks!\n",

            "It took me a while but I eventually found that I liked this book.  My wife thought it was a weird story and couldn't get past the training regimen that occurred throughout the story with Ender and the other kids.  I thought the ages of the kids was hard to get past until you started to see them as genius-level soldiers and especially with Ender, a level of maturity not usually seen in adults.  I was reminded of the training programs that the female gymnasts go through to prepare for the Olympics.  Most of them are young teens with exceptional athletic talents.  When you see how merciless the coaches are and how dedicated the athletes become you get a sense of what Ender faces.  Except that it's the survival of the human race that is at stake here not just a gold medal.  It was interesting to see how this story played out.  Since the reader had a little more information than Ender, you could anticipate some of the things that were going to happen to him throughout his training, at least until the end.  The climax of the story actually seemed kind of stale because Ender didn't seem to care by then what happens.  I know that this was only intended to be a 1st of four books, so you couldn't have a big ending because the story must go on.  I think that anyone who has had to go through intensive training for the military or for athletics can relate to this story.  It isn't exactly suspenseful or vividly descriptive science fiction but the story builds and the characters grow.  I liked it enough to decide to read the sequels so I would recommend this book too.\n",

Add to that action, vampires, a feisty archeologist female protagonist (different!) and you&#8217;ve got me hooked. I really enjoyed the book and the thing that stuck in my mind most was the dogged focus of Reese, the cop, in his quest to get his man. This drives much of the plot and leads him into scrapes, adventure, romance and ultimately real danger. He will not give up, he is unstoppable and while at times has you&#8217;re tearing your hair out, you also want him to get the bad guys!

            "Review for The Warlord Wants Forever by Kresley ColeThe Warlord Wants Forever was my first taste of Kresley Cole&#8217;s writing style and I have to say it was pretty awesome. I was fairly disappointed when I got to the end of this novella. I am not judging it based on the length - more expressing my sadness that it ended. The characters are well developed and the way Cole describes not only the personality traits, but also the physiological traits of her creatures I felt as though they could be real. That is a hard thing to do in the world of paranormal. I can see why people rave about her series.In this book we have Myst, a Valkyrie. Valkyrie is a special kind of Lore, one that is basically considered the most kick bum and you really don&#8217;t want to mess with them. Myst is known as The Coveted One, she lures men to chase her, attack her, and she reveals in their hunt. One thing that is known among all of the Lore, Valkyrie don&#8217;t give their hearts.Nikolai Wroth is a Warlord, known for his cunning and ingenuity when it comes to battle; he is also a vampire. Unblooded vampire to be exact. I was really intrigued by the ingenuity that Cole put into her version of Vampire. When a vampire finds his mate and takes their blood into them their heart beats again, their lungs breathe once more, and they are able to sustain an erection. Prior to this blooding they are left in a living dead type state where they are unable to *ahem* smut things up.&#8232;There is a little bit of a downside to this blooding, if a vampire is blooded and doesn&#8217;t mate with his bride&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say he gets no satisfaction and pretty much lives with a perpetual hard-on and blue balls of epic proportions. I&#8217;m sure you get that Myst is Nikolai&#8217;s bride&#8230; the story takes place five years after she bloods him and leaves him in wanting. After five agonizing years he finally finds her again and well&#8230; you&#8217;ll have to read the book to find out how they get along&#8230; or don&#8217;t.I give this one 4 stars for ingenious storytelling and as for the smut level it&#8217;s a definite 4 drenched panties&#8230; for an overall FOUR star read!

The Leary series is usually full of Military Science Fiction Space action, but less so in this chapter of the series. It was still a very enjoyable story with more diplomatic style action than normal with any David Drake novel. It still develops in more depth the characters of Leary and Mundy. The fact that Cinnabar and the Alliance are at peace makes the story more of a Cold War style spy adventure story. There were still plenty of small combat action scenes both in space and on the ground to spice up the story. Good change of pace in the Leary series. Great Read!\n",

            "This is my fourth Graham Saga book and I'm just as excited with this time travel tale this many books in as I was with the first one that I read. I still haven't found time to read the very first book in the series but salient facts from past books are always seamlessly woven in so a new reader never feels lost. This fifth installment continues the lives of Alex and Matthew as they make their mark in the New World having left Matthew's beloved Scotland in fear of his life because of his religious convictions.This book seems more family focused with relationships beginning and ending, births, deaths and injuries filling the pages from beginning to end. The family is just trying to live in peace but it just doesn't seem to be their lot. Young Jacob leaves to see the world and all is not joy and happiness with everyone at the homestead. To write much more would spoil plot points.  The evil Burley brothers are stalking Matthew with the intent of killing him and this particular plot development is one that about drove me crazy. They were everywhere the Grahams were. In the 17th century world they always knew where they would be at the exact time? A little too convenient and it got a little comical where it most certainly wasn't meant to be.  I realize a book needs tension but their appearances were getting to be almost rote.Despite the Burley brothers I really did enjoy the book and I thoroughly enjoy these characters and the world in which they live. It's well developed whether it's taking place in London or the New World. You feel you are in the world with the characters as the writing transports you into their lives. I can't wait for the next installment so I can continue to follow the love story of Alex and Matthew Graham.*I received a free copy for my honest review\n",

It takes me there to the earlier times of how people approached the handing down of lore and the basis from which instills a matter of history from places people can no longer go except through time. The treating of the gathering of the material is one of the ways I feel it attempts to give us as real of a view of the area of subject matter as can ever be expected in a corridor of time. It is very real in reaching out to observe the ways.I highly recommend this book for the portion that I have had time to read it.I happened to get very lucky and bought it as a first edition that someone had apparently left in their basement of books. It even had a slight mold smell to it, so I know it was authentic :) I am very pleased with this find and this publication. It is an old edition that I have, but any of them will do just nicely to relate the information which feels very authentic and is well written, although it may be a tad dry reading for some folks.I have no problem getting on with reading it.\n",

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this one!The twist of the main male character having amnesia made for an interesting, intriguing and thoughtful story.  The situation placed a a good and decent (very manly) man--frowned upon by Society because of his gaming establishment--in close proximity with a very intelligent and witty (and sensual) woman--who was not the most beautiful and nearing the ripe old age of 29.  When each takes the other at face value, and without preconceived notions, sparks fly.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will look for more by this author.  I know she has many previous books, and in the distant past I'm sure I've read some of them, but with the reading of this one, I think I'll get reacquainted!\n",

            "I read this book with the 12 Books Group in June 2014.This book is full of simple and clear insights that work together to help anyone create a &#34;leader/leader&#34; culture. The author tells the story of his own experience as a captain in the US Navy and uses his experience to illustrate how to transform an organization that is used to top down command type leadership into one he describes as &#34;Leader/Leader&#34; in which each individual is truly empowered and proactive.I especially like the way the book is laid out into chapters will clear summaries at the end of each chapter with a review of the principle and how to put it into action.My favorite quote from the book, &#34;Move Authority to Where the Information Is.&#34;A few of the other golden nuggets I gleaned:The true ability of leadership is only measured and known after the leader leaves the organization. It is his &#34;clock-builder&#34; skills and not time-keeping skills that prove the test of time. This puts a greater emphasis on moving authority down the ladder.In order for the leader/leader model to work you must have competence and clarity. Competence requires a lot of training and finding the right people. Clarity requires making sure that everyone in the organization understand the WHY and has clear communication and expectations.Read this book and you will learn and improve!\n",

            "You probably don't know Carol Leifer by name but chances are you've seen her work. She has been a stand-up comedienne since the 70s; she wrote for Seinfeld and the Larry Sanders show. She also has written for a few Oscar telecasts, performed with Frank Sinatra and even had her own sitcom on the old WB network. Her writing work today can be found on popular series like Modern Family and Devious Maids.How to Succeed in Business Without Really Crying (great title by the way) is a book for aspiring stand-up comics, or others pursuing glamorous and creative careers. It is also part memoir, and Leifer revisits her early days in the stand up scene with one-time boyfriend Paul Reiser, Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld. A lot of the book, though, comes across as a job hunting guide for people who are extremely stupid. Sample tips: Don't be late for a job interview. Have good hygiene on the job. Don't wear sexy clothes. You don't say, Carol! I would never have figured that out.Throughout the memoir/job guide Leifer takes a know-it-all approach which is less than appealing. It's admirable that she worked so hard in the industry, and a lot of her stories illustrate that hard work, but she also does not mention that she got lucky too, knowing people like Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld, and how that may have furthered her career. It is also strange to read a job guide from someone in the stand-up business. Stand-up is such unconventional work and it's not like there's a clear path to stardom, a clear guide of how to get there. It mostly amounts to talent and luck and neither of those things can be taught (well, maybe talent can, but only a little). Leifer also believes her tips can help anyone in any industry and that is definitely not true.I also didn't care for the way she addressed the women-in-comedy conumdrum. She thinks she was lucky to be a woman in stand-up in the 70s,  when it was acknowledged it was a boys club. She doesn't take men to task for holding women back in comedy, and thinks women are just complaining too much and not working hard enough to change the system.That being said, this is an amusing book, and it's fun to hear backstage gossip--spoiler alert: Diana Ross and Lorne Michaels come off like total douches--but I would have much rather gotten an honest memoir from Carol about her life in comedy. She also mentions her partner briefly but never talks about what it was like to discover she was gay mid-life.If you are looking for a really good book on being a woman in stand up comedy, I highly recommend We Killed by Yael Cohen. It gives a very broad, balanced perspective on this same subject.\n",

            "This well-written, short book purports to be a contribution to a theory of value.  Scheffler asks us to imagine as a thought-experiment two grim scenarios and then asks us to think about how these possibilities would affect the way we think about what we value or, as he says more often, &#34;what matters to us.&#34;  The two scenarios involve a world without a human future, the &#34;afterlife&#34; of the title being the continued life of the human race (a communal afterlife) and not the &#34;personal afterlife&#34; that some religious traditions offer.  Scheffler is not interested in the latter possibility.  The two scenarios are &#34;The doomsday scenario&#34; --&#34;Suppose you knew that, although you yourself would live a normal life span, the earth would be completely destroyed thirty days after your death in a collision with a giant asteroid&#34; (18) -- and &#34;the infertility scenario&#34; -- everyone alive now would live out his or her normal life span, but in a world where no children are being born to create a future generation and future generations beyond that.Dire, eh?  We would feel bad, of course, and we would perhaps ask ourselves about whether what we have up to that point been doing with our lives is worth continuing with.  And there can be no doubt that there would be changes in our ways of thinking about whether or not this or that project was worthwhile.  We would have to acknowledge that our sense of what matters to us often does unthinkingly take for granted not just the lives of our own children and grandchildren but generations of people we will never know.  As Scheffler says, &#34;our confidence that there will be an afterlife is a condition of many other things mattering to us here and now&#34; (32).  One can agree with this, broadly . . . but is belief in an afterlife a NECESSARY condition of things mattering here and now?Scheffler's strongest claim is that such a belief is indeed a necessary condition of our valuing.  Here's how he frames that strong claim: &#34;We need humanity to have a future for the very idea that things matter to retain a secure place in our conceptual repertoire&#34; (60).  I read this as meaning that we could not possibly provide good reasons for our valuing ANYTHING without a belief in a communal afterlife.  Notice that we might still prefer some things or courses of action to others; we might like some things better than others -- but we could not possibly give good reasons for our judgments of value, absent an afterlife in Scheffler's sense. (&#34;I just like X or Y or Z&#34; not being a good reason, or indeed a reason at all.)The rest of the book seems to be a clarification of what that claim entails -- about temporality in relation to value, for example -- rather than an argument in support of the claim.  The claim in its strongest form (p. 60) remains, I think, just a claim, provocative to be sure, because the relations of our values to time are worth thinking about, even without the dire contexts of the doomsday and infertility scenarios.  It seems to me that what Scheffler is also wanting to get at is the idea that his thought experiments show that our values are not at bottom egoistical or individualistic.  The very act of valuing, he would like us to believe, is finally a commitment to a communal rather than a purely selfish end.  This amounts to an extension of the strong claim, and it is worth pondering, but it doesn't GROUND the claim, which, as I said, remains asserted and elaborated rather than argued.In the group with which I read and discussed the book, there was discussion of reasons why we might continue valuing (keeping the notion of value in our conceptual repertoire), one of which started from the Aristotelian distinction between process (kinesis) and activity (energeia), the former being goal-oriented and the latter being a matter of &#34;valuing in the act of doing.&#34; (My thanks to my friend Jim Edwards for the distinction).  Certain very long-term goal-oriented projects might come to seem less valuable.  But would our sense of the value of artistic appreciation or musical performance be diminished?  Might the value of such activities not be heightened?  You get the idea . . .? Lots of food for thought here, and the book includes not just Scheffler's three essays but some responses from philosophers and Scheffler's response to them.  Recommended.\n",

Zeke doesn't know, but he's going to figure it out.Zeke is an alpha of his pack. His pack is half-breed friendly. They don't tolerate Mary's pack and slaughter them all except two of the females. Mary is one of the two remaining. Mary bargains to save another young female wolf with her body. Zeke willingly takes Mary as his sex toy for the next month.The blurb of this story is darker than the actual story. This is a sweet fast-paced story of soul mates finding each other. Mary's transformation to a werewolf reminds me of Elena from Kelley Armstrong's Women of Otherworld. The experimentation on shifters reminds me of one of Patricia Briggs' Mercy arc. The world building in this is leveraging a lot on other existing werewolf mythologies so it's easy to follow and understand. The conflict in the story is also pretty easy to figure out and predict how it will resolve.The characters in this story are fun. They aren't too complicated but they do become endearing. Zeke is a sweet tough guy. Mary is a woman coming into her beast. The chemistry between the two is good. The heat factor is medium.Overall, this is a sweet story with the powerful doing their best to protect the weak. This is paranormal romance is recommended for those who enjoy soul mate shifter themes.\n",

            "For much of this book I was riveted. Katie Hafner is a skillful writer and brings emotions to the page, while keeping the \"plot \" (if you can call it that in a memoir) moving along. It felt a bit long to me, though, which is why I didn't give it four stars. I know her relationship with her mother, and coming to terms with her childhood, is the primary topic of the book. But about 60% of the way through I started to feel like I was with a self-centered friend who never stops focusing on herself and her own endless psychological self-explorations. Enough awready, I felt like saying. (I borrowed it from the library and read it on Kindle Fire, which does not give page numbers...so I was surprised when coming here to review it, to notice that it is only 288 pages. It felt longer.)Hafner hits the nail on the head, many times. However, she glosses relatively lightly over her own \"sins \" as a mom (a second marriage that was terrible for her only child), describing her daughter's unhappiness in clinical and detached terms, and using emotionless, tepid words like \"regretfully \" when explaining her own self-centered choices and actions. The sudden \"arm's length\" approach in this part of the book is noticeable, because when describing her own mother's flaws and poor choices, Hafner expresses (beautifully) her feelings of pain...no arm's length there. The fact that Hafner wrote and published this book despite the fact that her mom is \"less than thrilled \" to be featured in the book is a fact one can't forget while reading the book.\n",

(As opposed to, say, many of the freebie poetry collections, which are so garbled that they really are unreadable.)So, you could dedicate your life to understanding \"Flatland\" and all of the commentary it has spawned, (in which case you probably do need to see the illustrations), or you could read this for free and become that much more an accomplished and broadly experienced scholar. I'd encourage you to download this and read it. It actually is a charming, inventive and provocative work. At the very least you'll feel smarter after you've read it.\n",

            "An autobiography about growing up in Leeds Castle in England and taking it all for granted.My TakeThe memories are from a child&#8217;s perspective, and a shy one at that. It reads like a sanitized version of a dysfunctional childhood, all very surface with little revealed. Sorry, read that as &#8220;understated&#8221;.Oh, perhaps that&#8217;s not a fair comment, but I grew irritated with Russell harping on about how living at Leeds Castle and having everything done for him didn&#8217;t prepare him for the real world. No kidding. What bugged me was Russell never gave any examples of how this screwed things up. It was so generalized.As for his outrageous fortune in living and growing up in such a fabulous setting, that&#8217;s all it was&#8230;a frame. There was nothing substantial inside it. His nanny was more of a parent to him than his own parents or his grandmothers. In spite of living with his maternal grandmother, he reckons he only actually spoke to her a handful of times. How sad is that?As fabulous as the house was, I didn&#8217;t feel as if Russell appreciated the history of where he grew up. Instead, lol, it was a child&#8217;s concerns and fears, which were all too similar to children growing up at any social level, although I think most children at the lower levels had it better with parents and grandparents who spent time with their kids, compared to what Russell was given. Yes, he&#8217;s never had to worry about paying the rent or affording food, but he&#8217;s never had the love or interactions one would expect from a family.I regret that his parents ignored so much of what could have benefited him as opposed to what&#8217;s always been done. It certainly sounded as if there was no interest in helping Anthony find purpose or find him playmates, and instead he spent his days with Nanny.He does mention the people who were guests at the castle, frequent and occasional, the famous, the political, and merely noble. He refers to the perpetual bachelors, a euphemism for gay, who paid court to his grandmother. How his grandmother&#8217;s &#8220;court&#8221; spent their year, the poor treatment meted out to his mother, his own experiences at boarding school.His father&#8217;s mother, Granny A, sounds like a single-minded rebel, a poor one compared to Granny B, but much more real. He mentions that she insisted there be no sex when Granny A married his grandfather, and I find that a truly odd insistence. Why would John Russell, Anthony&#8217;s grandfather, even marry a woman who didn&#8217;t want to produce children? I thought that was always the be-all, end-all for the aristocracy? Producing an heir?The CoverThe cover is sweet with a faded family photograph of Anthony and his brothers in front of Leeds Castle: David on his bike and Anthony leaning on the toy car in which James is sitting. A nice blend of the normal with the grand.The title is how Anthony sees his childhood, a bit of Outrageous Fortune.\n",

            "There are some books that touch your heart and Heart Like Mine by Amy Hatvany was such a book for me.  I listened to the audio version narrated by Cassandra Campbell and she is fast becoming one of my favorite narrators.  I find the tone of her voice and her way of telling the story captivates me from beginning to end.  Heart Like Mine is an emotional and moving story that perfectly portrays not only the struggles of womanhood but also the joys and sorrows of families; even those not your own.Grace, at thirty-six years old, has never had the urge to be a mother.  She&#8217;s happy with her career and her life the way it is.  When she meets Victor, a restaurant owner, and learns that he has two children, Ava and Max, who live with their mother she really doesn&#8217;t think too much about it.  They stay with their mother for the most part and Grace pretty much stays out of the way when the kids are spending time with their father.  Things quickly turn around though when their mother Kelli passes away under questionable circumstances and suddenly Victor is no longer a part-time father, but a full-time one instead.Grace is torn because of course she understands that the kids come first and naturally her heart breaks for these kids but at the same time she is being pulled into a life she isn&#8217;t sure she wants.  A life that involves caring for the kids, picking them up from school, and all that other stuff that a mother would normally do.  Matters are made worse by the fact that Ava, at thirteen years old, is none too happy to have Grace around at all and takes every opportunity to throw it in her face.  Despite the fact that Grace doesn&#8217;t feel equipped to deal with the kids her heart really goes out to Max, who younger seems more open to a relationship with her and even to Ava who she feels is just acting out her grief.  Still she really has to question herself as to whether she can handle all the changes that have been thrown at her and ultimately she has to ask herself whether she is really cut out for a ready made family.While this barely touches the surface of the depth of this book I think the real impact of the novel is in the emotions that it evokes.  Whether you&#8217;re single, in a relationship, have kids or don&#8217;t, or have lost someone close to you there is some aspect of this book that almost everyone can find to relate to.  I found I related most to Grace in that I don&#8217;t have children other than my puppy and while I like kids I&#8217;ve never felt an overwhelming urge to have any and I like how Amy Hatvany portrayed that in the story &#8211; that it&#8217;s ok if you don&#8217;t want kids; that not everyone does and it doesn&#8217;t make you any less of a woman for choosing not to have any.  What I do know is that Heart Like Mine would make one fantastic book club pick!  Wow, there are just so many points to discuss in this novel ranging from blended families, having children or not having them, love, grief, and hope.  I just can&#8217;t imagine not having some really good talks arise from sharing this book with your book club buddies and to assist you there is even a Reading Group Guide.The novel is narrated by Grace and Ava with flashbacks to Kelli&#8217;s past and I think the audio version splendidly portrays the differences in the emotions of all these characters.  I&#8217;m not sure I would have felt the same emotional connection if I had read the book as I did in listening to it because you could feel the characters emotions coming through in the way that Cassandra Campbell brought them alive. For me Heart Like Mine was a beautiful book and I think the audio version just added that extra something special to it.  I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to recommend this book and if you have read it I&#8217;d love to hear if you enjoyed it as much as I did!\n",

            "The author did a great job of writing a love story where the female did not need to be less than so that the male could be more than.  I enjoyed the character of Kit/Emily, who was real ( she has daddy issues),smart, resourceful (when dealing with her disability) and in love.  Of course, Logan was the cat's meow and the fact that the author gave him a disability and showed how he managed to navigate through the world and live his life, made him even more memorable.  I enjoyed the balance in their relationship and the sex scenes were hot, lolI noticed that there is a sequel to this story. I tend to avoid sequels because they usually end up being about much unnecessary angst and drama, which add nothing to the original story.  In addition, it is usually  a story that could/should  have been finished in one book. Hopefully, this will be the exception?  There is enough characters to write many books.\n",

The wolf elders decide she is to be the mate of Merrick the next leader of the pack. She fights this revelation tooth and nail, but Merrick is determined to win her over.Fury is more about the erotic story than an romance story. You feel as if you are dropped in the middle of a standing book. The premise of the story really has potential to be a novel, if the story and characters were explored more and expanded upon. Since ANya Bast is a well known author, i believe her intent was just an erotic short story which she executed well. I just happen to love the story and the build up of rapport with characters as much as the hot scenes, which is why it fell flat for me. But if you are looking for a quick passionate read, this book and it's companion OtherKin Tranquility are for you!I give it 2 stars for the story and 4 for the bedroom scenes, so a 3 overall.Review posted on bookaddict29.tumblr.com\n",

            "This book covers the first three years of Buchanan's association with Richard Nixon, from 1965 to 1968. The opening chapter provides a bit of history leading up to that point. Nixon had been a very successful politician early in his career, elected to Congress in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950, then becoming Eisenhower's Vice President in 1952.  By 1960, only 47 years old, he had gained vast exposure on the world stage traveling on behalf of the US government and the Eisenhower administration.Despite losing the presidency, the Democrats had expanded their presence in both houses of congress and statehouses during the Eisenhower administration.  Registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by about two to one.  Eisenhower, who could have run on either party's ticket, was simply not a party builder for the GOP.  The lack of political infrastructure, and a consistently hostile press, were handicaps that proved impossible for Nixon to overcome.Buchanan has some good observations on the way the campaigns were run in 1960. They involved a lot of personal appearances, as neither candidate had yet figured out how to fully leverage television. When they did, it benefited Kennedy more than Nixon as he was the more telegenic man.Buchanan, as an editorial writer at the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, saw what few others would have imagined: that Nixon was likely to be a contender again in the 1968 elections.  Quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes \"It is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived,\" Buchanan approached Nixon with an offer to serve.After losing to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon planned his comeback via the governorship of California. California politics was then as now a rather confused.  As always, the press treated Nixon viciously.  Unable to rally the support of the fickle California GOP establishment, the camp of Knowland, Kuchel and Earl Warren, Nixon lost to Edmund G \"Pat\" Brown, the father of the present Gov. Jerry Brown.  After his loss, he decided to wash his hands of politics, and the press was quick to dismiss him.Nixon moved to New York and founded the law firm of Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie and Alexander. His national and international exposure was extremely valuable for attracting clients, and the firm prospered. Practicing law, however, bored Nixon, and he kept his hand in politics.  When Buchanan called, Nixon decided he could use somebody to help with the writing and the planning of his travels and appearances. He subjected Buchanan, young and not highly credentialed, to a very thorough interview before inviting him as the anchor member of his reelection team.The substance of the book starts with the 1966 by-elections. At that point Johnson's Great Society was in full swing, programs put in place with a veto proof majority in both houses of Congress. The Republicans were unable even to function as a loyal opposition, questioning the wisdom of Johnson's social programs or the war in Vietnam.The Republican establishment, Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Jacob Javits to name three, had refused to support Barry Goldwater actively in 1964.  Nixon, despite reservations about some of Goldwater's rhetoric, campaigned for him in 36 states.  Though the candidate was thoroughly trounced, conservatives remembered Nixon as a loyal friend.Again in 1966 Nixon took it upon himself to become the best-known Republican to campaign nationally on behalf of Republican candidates. He focused his efforts more on rookies, those without the advantage of incumbency, and earned a great many debts of gratitude as the Republicans gained 47 house seats in 1966.The press did not give him credit for the success, nor did they see him shedding his loser image or reemerging as a candidate for 1968. This contented Nixon. Leaving Romney and Rockefeller to fight it out for the limelight, he was satisfied to remain in the background, continuing to do good works on behalf of the party.The 1960s was a time of huge social issues and turmoil. While Buchanan does not dwell on the sexual and the drug revolution, he dedicates a great deal of space to discussing the antiwar movement and the race issue.The protesters against the war behaved as though their cause was so just, that the war was so immoral, that they were justified in breaking whatever laws were necessary in their protests. I observed it as a student at Berkeley in 1964. My take at the time was that these antiwar activists did not really have a coherent point of view, that the protesters could not articulate what they were fighting against and could not talk rationally about the war. They did know that they did not want to be shot at, and powerful social trends had eroded their respect for their elders, government in general and the war effort in particular. Their opposition had been subdued when Kennedy had been President, but it blossomed when the unsympathetic Southerner Lyndon Johnson took over.Buchanan's take at the time was authentically conservative. A society without rule of law, a society which cannot conduct arguments civilly, is not healthy whatsoever. It is a dangerous society.  It was wrong to indulge the antiwar protesters, as the liberal establishment and the media did.The same applied to violence in race questions. The liberal theory was that blacks had been held down, systematically mistreated, and now they were only demanding what was fair using the only means at their disposal. Buchanan's observation is that Blacks in America were materially better off than most peoples in the world, and were poor only in relation to whites. Moreover, Blacks had enjoyed relatively equal and open access to the benefits of American society. There were many successful Blacks that one could point to in the 1960s: US Ambassador to the United Nations Ralph Bunche, Sen. Edward Brooke, and many figures in professional sports and in business.  There were, in fact, many successful blacks even in 19th century America.  It simply was untrue to say that the blacks had been oppressed to the point that they could not succeed.The Black resistance, chronicled by Tom Wolfe in his articleRadical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers, was not a just rebellion against oppression, it was a question of Blacks doing what they could get away with.  My view, as a National Guard soldier, echoed those of Wolfe and Buchanan.  I was driving a 2  ton army truck, trying to avoid badly parked Cadillacs in Watts. The irony was striking - Cadillacs in front of single-family homes are not a symbol of a poverty-stricken society. Moreover, curiously, the businesses the Blacks burned were the very businesses that served their communities in Watts, Hunters Point, and later Washington DC. The damage they did was felt most severely by their own people. Buchanan, as a native Washingtonian, felt the injury when the Blacks in 1968 burned the seventh and fourteenth Street corridors of that city.Buchanan quite accurately saw the Soviets as duplicitous and opportunistic. He recounts how they goaded Nasser to start a war with Israel, and then did not back him up when it blossomed into a real fight. It is exactly the same today.  Putin has induced a motley collection of rebel forces to start fights in Ukraine, but seems unwilling to back up these people that he encouraged to start trouble on his behalf.  As an aside, not in the book, it amazes me that Buchanan is able to claim that God is on Putin's side simply because the West has become so godless.  He may recall that Hitler also claimed God. In any case, Buchanan's accurate descriptions of the Soviet activities in the 1960s are pretty much identical to what is going on in the teens of the 21st century.[British PM Douglas-Home's] focus was on Russia's role in the recent war. The Soviets are in this thing \"up to their necks,\" he said. They have twin goals: make Nasser dominant in the region, and, through him, gain a Soviet foothold in Africa. Asked how this affected \"detente,\" Sir Alec said the Soviets move when they see an opportunity. They always have. Like a knife, they push ahead when they hit butter, and back away when they hit steel. Where they run into unity and strength, relations tend to improve. Soviet policy seeks \"a maximum of confusion for a minimum of commitment.\" The Soviets did not intervene militarily in the Arab-Israeli war because they do not commit their military power far from their homeland.\"Buchanan quotes Churchill as saying that \"The belief that security can be obtained by throwing a small state to the wolves is a fatal delusion.\"  That is true, and the small states currently in play are Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldoa and Ukraine.  I remind Pat should he be reading this review.This book is a satisfying read in a great many ways. Buchanan is as articulate and consistent of a conservative voice as one will find in America. It is a remarkable piece of history for him to have witnessed as a man in his late 20s. He was close to the centers of power, with keen powers of observation, and half a century later he is well served by a great memory and a great many archives to draw from. This book is altogether a five-star effort.\n",

            "There are many &#34;Mary's&#34; mentioned in the New Testament. Which one are we talking about here? Mary of Bethany was a quiet woman who loved the Lord. She chose to anoint His feet with precious ointment and was blessed by Him for that act. Judas, always looking at the money angle, thought it should be &#34;sold.&#34; But, Mary chose to give it to Jesus in a very humble, emotional way. Mary also chose to sit at Jesus' feet and listen instead of serving, much to her sister's chagrin. That was a teachable moment for Martha. So, you might ask, what does this have to do with me? What is its relevance to my life? In her new book, Dolores Kimball takes us on a journey to discover Mary's secrets. In this Bible study, she gives plenty of Scripture to go along with the story she tells. So come along and gain insights on life choices, listening, silence, worship, and peace.Mary of Bethany is one of my favorite Bible women and I was happy to be offered a review copy of this book. As I went through the book for this review I quickly found that I want to go back and take a longer time period to really dive into the Scripture and study with Ms. Kimball. I recommend it to ladies out there who want to learn from the examples we have in the Bible. It would also make a wonderful group study. I received my review copy from Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for an honest review.\n",

The book shows how to alter ourselves and our minds because we can sometimes trap ourselves in a prison made by our own doings and thinkings. I found the book to be enlightening and very thought provoking. It made me analyze my own thoughts and actions and see where I'm holding myself back. The author's writing was pretty clear and very understandable, and I found a lot of his tips and techniques to be practical and useable. I was able to implement some of the tactics immediately and have already gotten something out of it. If you're looking for a way out of your own prison, I highly recommend this book.\n",

            "&#34;In the Blood&#34; is an extreme psychological thriller about people who have inherited psychological (and sometimes psychopathic) problems. These issues may be disturbing to some readers.Lana Granger has experienced great psychological stress in her youth, especially when her father is convicted of killing her mother. Lana was in the house at the time of her mother's death and her father made her help him dispose of the body. Lana's Grandfather was a convicted murderer.Now in her early 20's Lana is stable under a cocktail of psychotic and anti-depression drugs and amazingly she decides to study child psychology at college. Her psych professor finds her a &#34;suitable&#34; part-time job looking after an 11 year old boy, Luke, after school. Luke has a genius IQ but attends a special school because he has already been diagnosed as a violent control-freak psychopath.Luke's mother, Rachel, has had terrible experiences as a single mother bringing up and controlling Luke (there is no mention of his father).  For safety she locks Luke in his room each night. She welcomes Lana's help as others haven't been able to connect with Luke.This unbelievable connection between two seriously affected individuals starts up a dangerous liaison. Luke likes to play games that give him control of people in his life, especially his mother and now Lana. With the disappearance of her best friend, Becky, and the impact of Luke's sick mind games Lana struggles to maintain her sanity.While this was a well written book, especially the flashback diary sequences, the extreme and far-fetched psychological issues that underpinned this book made it difficult for me to really enjoy it.\n",

            "Todd S. Purdum has written an excellent book about the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This Act and the Voting Rights Act of the following year are rightly associated with the transformation of the nation away from the most vicious aspects of post-Civil War racism. The immediate context for the 1964 bill was the struggle to end segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, a struggle characterized by the astounding bravery of the marchers and the terrorist tactics of the supporters of white supremacy.It is perhaps a little known fact that the federal government can enact legislation but has few means of enforcing it. Segregation in bus stations, for example, can be declared illegal by Congress, but local police may choose not to enforce the law, local prosecutors may choose not to prosecute law-breakers, and local juries may choose not to convict them. One goal of the Civil Rights Act was to address this problem by giving more power to the federal government to protect the rights of minorities who typically could expect nothing but humiliation and violence from the local authorities.Who will want to read this book? At the very least:o Anyone interested in the history of the 1960s.o Anyone who has readParting the Waters: America in the King Years, Part I - 1954-63andPillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-65by Taylor Branch.o Anyone interested in the process of social change.Purdum does several things very well in this book. He introduces a wide cast of characters and describes them with empathy. He explains clearly how the time was right for this Act and how the forces aligned to make a reality. He helps us to understand the mindset of the segregationists: how they resented the 14th amendment (guaranteeing equal protection before the law) as having been forced on them during reconstruction; how they could paradoxically use the word liberty to justify depriving others of liberty.The author also makes clear how different things were in 1964:o African-Americans could not drive long distances through the South because of the lack of places where they could sleep, eat, or use a bathroom.o Liberal was not yet a label to be shunned. There were liberal Republicans such as Rep. John V. Lindsay, the future mayor of New York.o By percentage, more Republican senators supported the bill than Democratic senators. In fact, the Civil Rights platforms of the two parties in 1960 were nearly identical.o Segregationists did not hesitate to assert the superiority of the white race.In the end, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed, having endured months of filibusters and arcane Senate rules. Readers will heave a sigh of relief when the final roll-call is tallied. But we also are too aware of what is coming: the Vietnam War, urban riots, and white backlash. Nevertheless, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the heroes from the streets of Birmingham to the corridors of the Capitol who made this Act possible.\n",

This is in essence a very pleasant, Long - Short story.  Would have liked a little more technical detail about what and how steel would be produced using the stories scenario and more development of the characters.As a general statement concerning the series as a whole, I would like to see in all of the Ring of Fire series some consideration given to differing standards of beauty.  The downtime female protagonist is &#34;beautiful&#34;, but in reality how would a typical uptime man view a woman with very hairy legs and other body parts.  Obviously standards of beauty change with both exposure and experience but I've always been bothered by the &#34;love at first site scenarios&#34; in the Ring series, especially in the 1632 and 1633 time frame before experience has reeducated our standards of beauty.

As I read this book, I had my Bible right beside me, reading each selected passage she used. I thoroughly enjoyed this study.Mrs. Blight explores five areas of Christian belief by devoting one chapter to each concept. Inside each chapter, she breaks the topic into five smaller units of study.She shares her heartbreaking personal crisis that happened shortly after she graduated from college. She tells the reader how she came to give all her anger and hurt over to God and how God has used her to minister to other women.I would recommend this Bible Study to any woman who truly wants to grow in the Lord. However, my concern is that the price may be out of range of a lot of women who could benefit from this study.I received a copy of this book from Booklook Bloggers, a program of Harper Collins Christian Publishing Inc. via Thomas Nelson Publishing.

            "Data from the US Census Bureau shows the number of Americans who divorced their spouses in 2012 increased for the third year in a row to 2.4 million.  The increasing divorce rate comes as the marriage rate in the United States has plummeted to its lowest level in over a century. Since 1970, the marriage rate in the US has declined by almost 60 percent.So what does all that mean?  It means that there is something basically wrong with marriages in the US.Sherri Mills, author of I Almost Divorced My Husband But I Went on Strike Instead, has written a very insightful book that highlights some of the problems. Ms. Mills is not a researcher, psychologists or marriage counselor - well not as we normally think of marriage counselors.  Ms. Mills is a hairdresser whose career spans over 40 years. During that time she has heard the full range of marriage problems, from both men and women, and has come to some very simple but effective suggestions for improving the success of most marriages.This book is not about marriages where there are deep psychological or behavioral problems.  This book is about your everyday marriage, where two people start out totally in love but gradually drift apart, resentment builds up and they eventually decide the marriage can't be saved.Ms. Mills based her insights on her own marriage.  She was trying to do it all, hold down a full time job, do all the \"housework\" and take care of the children.  Her husband felt his responsibility to the marriage was to provide an income.Our cultural beliefs about marriage are still rooted in a way of life that no longer exists.  Most men still expect the wife to handle all the housework.  Most wives accept that their role is to do \"the woman's work\".  But with more and more women working outside the house, that unbalanced division of household chores no longer works.  And there can be a lot of resentment built up over an unbalanced sharing of the workload.One of the most telling things Ms. Mills found when talking to women about the problems they were having in their marriage was that they had failed to communicate their concerns to their husbands.  They expected their husbands to know what was wrong.  Failure to communicate the wants and needs lies at the foundation of marriages that are doomed to fail.Ms. Mills writes in a very down to earth, conversational tone.  The book is filled with numerous examples of marriages that encountered difficult times because of the imbalance in sharing of household chores and the inability to effectively communicate the resentment associated with it.Unfortunately far too many women have come to believe that divorce is the answer to an unhappy marriage.  As Ms. Mills points out, some marriages can't be saved - those with abusive spouses, addiction problems, etc. But, for many women, getting a divorce only adds to the problems.  \"A 2012 General Accountability Office report found that after divorce, women's household income fell 41 percent on average. The income fell 20 percent for men.\"For those marriages that have simply drifted apart and are suffering from adhering to cultural norms that are no longer workable, this is an excellent guide which could save your marriage.I was provided a review copy of this book.\n",

Claire had a huge crush on Ty, and when they run into each other in Las Vegas things get a little crazy. Ty and Claire end up in a twenty-four hour wedding chapel and get married. The next morning Claire&#8217;s dreams are shattered when Ty says he has a girlfriend and that Tawny is the one he wants to marry.Fast forward five years, Ty reenters Claire&#8217;s life but she&#8217;s not alone. She has a five year old little girl  . . . Ty&#8217;s daughter. When it is revealed that Ty is the father, the relationship between Addie and Ty is a precious daddy and daughter one. Ty dotes on Addie, and it is super sweet.The banter between Claire and Ty is both hilarious and frustrating, as you can see the writing on the wall.Becky writes a great romance, however this is not just a great summer romance that will keep you up late into the night. It is a book about accepting and giving forgiveness, not only from each other, but from God. At one point in the book, I found myself beginning to pray for these characters, which took me completely by surprise.This is the second book in the Porter Family series however it can be read as a stand alone.I highly recommend this book!\n",

            "wow. oh wow I am speechless I mean speechless at how beautiful and amazing this book was. The writing was powerful and draws you into this web of intrigue and memories. the adage oh what a tangled web we weave does come into play here.the writing: beautiful. The flow was perfect and the descriptions were intriguing. I like how this is written like a chess match with live people and emotions. The emotion can be felt through the words used. Oh and the cloth scene. Le sighthe plot: the love triangle angle was a continuation from the previous books. the added bonus of the stories Nora tells is amazing. the vengeance and punishment concept is intriguing. Not a new plot but with how Ms. Reisz has written it you have a new outlook on what can happen when betrayal and heartbreak gets entangled with a disturbed, callous, self centered self absorbed individual being on the receiving end of that betrayal.the characters: let's take them individuallyGrace: she got on my last nerve at times. I mean coming on to Soren when he was in despair and about to make the toughest choice of his life. Except for Soren it wasn't. Here is Grace coming to America to see Nora and than she goes to the penthouse and demands to be in the know. demands I mean come on you don't know her as well as everyone else. Than her arrangement with Zach is odd but okay. What gets me though is how she was with Soren just didn't like. Overall she was okay but I didn't like her blatant ways with Soren.Marie: Kingsley's sister. The self absorbed who has Nora. You couldn't have created a better evil yet freaky character. At times you felt a wee bit and I mean a miniscule wee bit sorry for her only because of how she perceives her brother's love and all the betrayal in her life. I love how whackadoodles she truly is.Kingsley: He is the King for a reason. His love for Soren and Juliet know no bounds. He is brave and when it comes to his sister loyal. He even shows some morals on killing. His desire to protect is beautiful and we even see his love for Nora. He shows respect to Wesley as well.Wesley: Okay there were times I wanted to go AHH! He is a enigma at times. He loves Nora no doubt but he was starting to grow feelings for Soren's niece. Watch that one bub that is Soren's niece and he is a Sadist remember. Wes is the perfect oxymoron. he is vanilla in love with the idea of Nora who is a ex dominatrix. Wes can never go anything but vanilla. I truly believe he is in love with the ideal of Nora the person he believes she can be in his mind. He admires Nora and respects her but I don't know if it is a soul searching love. How he is with Soren's niece is beautiful though. He even begins to like Soren.Sorenthere are no words to describe this amazing incredible beautiful gorgeous kind sweet priest. those words pale in comparison to what he is. A gentle soul. Yes he is a priest and sadist but he is still a compassionate and beautiful man. His willingness to sacrifice is incredible selfless and beautiful. How he opens up in this book is sweet and tender to see. The many facets of Soren are seen. The only aspect that I found disturbing was the last scenes with Grace. I guess because in all the other books he adamantly declared the only woman he would ever be intimate with is his eleanor and this woman has this beautiful declaration broken. i loved his tenderness with Eleanor and what he was willing to do for her.Nora: Still funny, sarcastic and a firecracker. her stories will have you laugh, cry and smile.A absolutely beautiful and incredible book that will have you hanging on every word.\n",

            "** Spoiler Alert**First thing, I read this book as soon as it came out and debated on writing a review.  I was taught, if you can't say something good, don't say anything at all, but I just have to.  In all the books I've read, over 500 in the last three years, I have never been disappointed in the ending, until now.  I was so excited when I started this series, I read the first two books in two days, and before the third book came out I read them again, just as quickly.  I was drawn to it by Blane and Kat's love story, two lost souls who found each other.  Kade irritated me from the beginning, he was like a gnat that kept flying in your face and you just wanted to smack it. He claimed that he loved his brother so much, yet he had no problem putting the moves on Kat whenever he could, even though he knew Blane was in love with her.When the fourth book came out, I lost all respect for Kat and never had respect for Kade.  For someone who didn't want to come between the brothers, she sure changed her tune quickly.Before this book came out, I stayed away from reading anything about it, because I didn't want any hint as to who she chose.  So I was highly disappointed when I saw the table of contents, it told me who it was immediately, all it mentioned was Kathleen, Kade, and Kathleen & Kade, no mention of Blane.  I almost didn't even read the book.  Than, her being pregnant with Kade's kid , a quarter of the way in, I almost quit, but I continued but with a heavy heart, skipping parts along the way, just to get to the end.I understand that this was the only way to end it so that everyone could stay in each other's life.  Blane is the strong one and he can handle her choosing Kade, cause if she would have chosen Blane, Kade probably would have killed himself. What I don't understand is how Blane, the main character in the first books, turned out to be a secondary footnote in the last.  Why the knife had to be twisted in his back so many times (3 kids), just for one mistake in judgment, believing his uncle, the man who raised him.  Trust me, I would have believed him too, if I witnessed how Kat and Kade acted around each other.  This could have been avoided, if Kat would have told him what his uncle did in the first place.  I also think the relationship between Blane and Brenna is totally out of left field and an insult to our intelligence.I honestly do not see how Kade can be the better man for Kat.  He is a killer.  He killed 10 people, in cold blood, in the time he left her with Blane.  He shot her friend's boyfriend and would have killed him if Blane didn't show up, just cause she wouldn't tell him where Kat was, with no repercussions.  I'm so tired of how he could get away with doing and saying anything he wants, just because he was so abused as a child and his poor pitiful me, I don't deserve love act.  I think no matter that he put the word out that he was dead, someone will find out he's alive and will be looking for him and they will be watching their backs constantly.  What a life for their children.The only good part in this book, was the time spent with Blane.  He was so sweet to her.  I'm sad, cause he really loves Kat, and will always be there for her; and will live his &#34;content&#34; life, and probably never love again.I think there should have been alternate endings, and you choose which one you want.  I just downloaded a book like that, but haven't read it yet, I'll have to.I'm sorry that a series that started great, ended with a thud!!!!!!!!!  No warm fuzzy feeling for me!!!I will read future books, because I think Tiffany is a good writer, but not Kade's story, I've had just about enough of him that I can stomach!\n",

I didn't read the description detail, and thought it was another of his wacky, off-the-wall novels about Florida and it's population of crooks, con-men, sleaze-balls and land developers. (Florida is a lot like Alaska in that sense).  I didn't realize it was a collection of his Miami Herald columns.  I had not been exposed to his columns before, we don't get a lot of copies of the Herald here in Alaska.  However, now that I've read this collection, I realize that instead of being just novelist with a wicked sense of satire, he's another liberal, progressive, environmentalist, anti-gun, Bush-bashing partisan hack that would be perfectly at home on the editorial staff of the NYT.  In one sense, he's like Obama.  He &#34;has a gift&#34;.  Too bad that like Obama, he uses it to advance the progressive agenda.  I won't be buying any more of his books.\n",

But, it is absolutely necessary to have a friend or someone with some objectivity to read the item and indicate that words are missing.

Sadly, everything else is slapdash and haphazard.Not only are all characters beyond Dahlia given a cursory introduction and background at best, but the padding is blatantly obvious and excessive. Nothing is interesting, and the combat is needlessly long-winded, wordy and dull. It's as if Salvatore needed to reach a pre-specified word count rather than tell a gripping story. Most of the villains (who, presumably, will have their plotlines and motives fleshed out and concluded in the latter books of the Neverwinter saga) are cookie-cutter, self-obsessed and motivated by power and/or revenge. When half-demon tieflings have no qualms about slaughtering their own brethren, you know the author has given up on coming up with original or even complex and well-rounded ideas.The ending is so derivative and dull that it's not worth dignifying through criticism.\n",

            "As the owner of an appreciatively loving dog, previously rescued from a puppy mill, I knew I had to have this book when I saw it was written from the dog&#8217;s perspective.  I believe our canine friends have much to teach us, and in this way the author did not disappoint me.  I enjoyed the book, especially after watching my own dog single out hurting people and pay special attention to an ill family member.Mark has certainly caught that quality in creating the character of Wrigley, the mixed-breed &#8220;house dog&#8221; who tells the story about life in an assisted living facility.  This book provides an appreciative look at a dog&#8217;s world without excessively endowing Wrigley with human characteristics.In this way, Mark Asher seems to know dogs, but what really &#8220;ails&#8221; Mark is that he has scarcely a nodding acquaintance with grammar.Case in point #1:  &#8220;he felt badly...&#8221;  Really?  Was his sense of touch incorrect or improper?  When the verb to feel is used to describe an emotion, it requires a subjective complement instead of an adverb.  The adverb badly describes the verb, not the pronoun he.  If Mark wanted to describe how he was feeling emotionally, the appropriate word is bad.  To his discredit, Mark repeatedly makes this mistake.Case in point #2:  &#8220;he was doing alright...&#8221;  Impossible!  The English language contains no such word as alright.  Maybe that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s pronounced in casual speech, but the proper expression involves two words, which are all right.  As in Case #1, I can accept Mark&#8217;s using alright in a quoted speech by one of his less-than-accurate characters, but not in his own narrative.Perhaps there were no books on grammar for Wrigley to read at his assisted living home, but Mark should know better.  Since this is his first attempt at fiction, he would do well to acquire an English grammar.  Used copies of the Harbrace Handbook are available on line for only a penny (an excellent investment).Am I being picky?  Yes, but anyone who aspires to succeed must learn to use the tools of the trade.  The essential tools of a writer are words, so finding and using the right word is a basic requirement.  Far too many good stories are buried beneath the quagmire of poor grammar, and the author&#8217;s love for dogs deserves better grammar to describe it.\n",

So far, it has not affected me adversely. In fact, it has helped cut down the number of days and alleviate the intensity of the flu symptoms when I do get it.Twenty two teenagers from the Bloomberg High School thought the same thing.  Nothing would happen, right? They were wrong. They were prepared for possible headaches, sore arms, possible slight fever. They were not prepared to hear everyone - telepathically. So now they know everyone's secret, what everyone was thinking. That would be perfect, right?Don't Even Think About It is funny, sarcastic, revealing, poignant and engrossing. Be prepared to get immersed in teenage insecurities, angst, crushes, young love and betrayal.Forced to band together to deal with their new sensitivity, personalities who would normally not band together suddenly find themselves as part of a tight knit group. Preconceived notions and biases are slowly broken down as the group find themselves working together for support and understanding.  Sarah Mlynowski cleverly develops different plot points as she explores how this new talent influences relationships and decisions. Do you know that saying ... about being careful what you wish for? Well, these high school teenagers find out the hard way what it truly means.Life as they know has undeniably changed for the Bloomberg 22, and they will eventually be called to make a decision about their future.

            "The disappearance of a small child and the traditional structure of upstairs and downstairs collide in this Neo-Gothic tale shrouded in mystery and hidden secrets. Tyringham Park takes the reader into the complicated hive of the fictional ancestral Irish estate of the Blackshaw family where the staff may charm guests with obedience and structure but conceals behind closed doors sinister thoughts, poisonous gossip and dark resentment. Immediately the novel opens with the disappearance of the Park's darling little miss, the confusion that follows leads the reader to be marched from each station introducing them to each member of personnel and their whereabouts at the time of the child's disappearance. The observer soon becomes privy to the complicated relationships of those who share the prominent walls of Tyringham Park, the facade of privilege and status quickly falls and the misery and pettiness is exposed that reveals that something is horribly wrong within this grand house.The mystery continues to deepen and July 1917 soon becomes the 1920's, 1930's and finally the 1940's as the story follows the lives of those left behind to pick up the scattered memories of the lost Blackshaw child and the story travels from Ireland to the Australian outback and back again with swatches of time lapses and flashbacks to the history and origins of certain characters. Tyringham Park confronts many different subjects and depending on the reader may enjoy this twisted dramatic story of what happens behind closed doors of those seen born with silver spoons in their mouths.In the end this reader was somewhat disappointed. I sorely wanted to love this Gothic inspired read but found this novel was a little overly seasoned with predictable and unrealistic drama. Although the novel shined at certain points and I loved the complicated relationships that dominated the characters and the daring venturing into certain taboo topics; there was just something that overall lacked in the delivery of the eras the reader was shown and the presence of foreshadowing revealed numerous major points too early in the novel. Still Tyringham Park provided an interesting experience that I would recommend for those readers who love a historical fiction novel that takes drama to another level and blends mystery and complex relationships with the magnetic aristocratic world of former eras.*I would like to thank Atria Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy Tyringham Park\n",

However, Kate and Tommy are NOT kids anymore. They&#8217;ve both suffered through the years as the result of that one night. Both are determined to remain professional and away from each other. The flame between them doesn&#8217;t care about their desires to stay apart.

Her life drastically alters after she is attacked near school grounds, and the result of how that horrible incident affects her life and her choices after that.Resulting from the horrific event, she becomes pregnant and is placed in a predicament by the people who love her: to get an abortion. This book shows you how Dynah deals with her own decision, not one that she feels others have forced her into, and how by her own choice, she soon starts to heal from the pains of the past.

I love the gastrique recipes in here, I made the Lemon gastrique and blackberry gastrique, man oh man, delish. Love to drizzle some over my Greek yogurt. YUM. Made a cranberry molasses that works well to pour over yogurts and cakes as well. Many unusual recipes and the usual suspects alike are in here. Sweet and Savory alike.\n",

            "It is so refreshing as a historical romance fan to find a new author that you adore.  It is like finding a precious gem.  I enjoyed Miss Molly Robbins Designs a Seduction so much I didn't want it to end.  Molly is an inspiring heroine, with wit and a good head on her shoulders and a dream of having her own dressmaking shop.  Carver, our hero has been living for quite a few years with Molly underfoot as his sister's maid, and no one is more shocked than he when he actually misses her presence in his home.  They have a connection.  She knows him better than others to even predicting his needs before he voices them.  When she flees her wedding and asks him for a loan for her business he cannot think beyond keeping her at all costs in his life.  This is a brilliant story that will hold your interest effortlessly.  Ms. Fresina brings just the right amount of wit, banter and passion to mix up a lovely romance you will miss when you finish.  Miss the characters, and all that is her writing style.  I promptly bought every other book she has written.  You will love this book.  It's a keeper.\n",

            "3.5 StarsFirst off, I&#8217;m going to say I really enjoyed the first book in this series, Axel. It had me hooked early on with a very emotional scene, so I was really excited to read this next one. The intro to Cage isn&#8217;t quite at the same level, though. It&#8217;s almost an extension of the first book because it begins just before the wedding for Izzy and Axel, but told from the POV of the new couple who would take center stage. I was happy to see the other two get their happy ending, but it sort of diluted the effect for seeing Melissa and Cage meet. Then when they did it was a sort of insta-lust with only a bit of struggle to hold back on the part of Melissa.Mostly, I had to slug through until almost halfway through the book until a real plot beyond the romance emerged. Now this is just me, but I need the external plot to help build suspense and see what the characters are made of. There was only the slightest hints of it until that point, but once it kicked off, it really made the book so much more intense. I was really invested and wanted to see how things went. The story still isn&#8217;t quite as dramatic as the novel for Axel, but there is still some emotional scenes and some that really touched me.I liked Cage and his need to protect those he cares about. He can be so sweet. Melissa comes off as a bit too cocky about her looks in the beginning, but on the flip side I appreciated her ability to stick up for herself. This definitely set her apart from the previous heroine, Izzy, because she was so much stronger and tough. I grew to really appreciate her quick ability to see reason and not make silly assumptions without thinking things through first. The romance between her and Cage was rather fast, but that happens in real life and people do make it work. The author managed to convince me the couple was legit in their feelings and not many writers can do that with such a fast pace to getting to love.All in all, I enjoyed this book. I&#8217;d give the first half three stars and the second half four stars, rounding it out to 3.5. For those who enjoy good contemporary romances, I definitely recommend giving this series a try. I&#8217;ll be picking the next book up for sure!Note- I received a free ecopy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.\n",

This book had a great list for both male and female names. I liked how DiPastena took the time to indicate when a name was most popular or going out of fashion or restricted to a particular culture. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because I would have found it even more helpful if the author had included name translations since I prefer giving characters names that sum up their character, highlight an important aspect of or ideal behind the character, or is ironic. It's a great resource for medieval names and aids in determining whether a name will make your character part of the crowd or the odd duck out, but if you want to know the meaning behind the names, you'll have to compare it with medieval name sites (such as Behind the Name).\n",

            "Now you probably want to hear about the book. In short, I loved it. It was fast-paced, full of wit and suspense. Each character came with their own baggage, their own horrors, that they had to face. Justine was my favorite. She was a real hero in this story, pulling folks together, leading the way when the path was not clear. At first I didn&#8217;t care for Donald the writer. He was a bit of a dick. But then we get a peek at his deepest horror and shame and I think my heart cracked a little for him. After that, I liked him quite a bit. Mark was also a favorite as he faced a professional quandary as a war correspondent &#8211; what to publish and what to delete, how much truth to tell?I liked that not everyone survived (because I do find it unrealistic when all the good guys survive a paranormal attack of some sort). The pacing was good (never a dull moment). And the mix of people was great &#8211; various sizes, various skin tones, single, paired up, widowed, etc. The ending was more upbeat than the other two Lorn books I have read, so that was unexpected for me (but I liked it!). I really enjoyed that the characters had to go through some tough crap, face it, makes friends with it, and then they could attempt to come out the other side. Nothing was just given to the good guys.I&#8217;ve now read three Lord books and quite enjoyed each one. This one did not disappoint and may have been even more enjoyable because it was an audiobook and I could listen as I worked.Narration: Glen Marcum was an excellent fit for this audiobook. He infused the story with tension, tenderness, pissed-offness, etc. as needed. Edward Lorn writes well, and Glen Marcum did a great job of giving those characters a voice. I especially like his voices for Lyle and for Justine. Oh, and Trevor (who sounded stoned throughout the book).\n",

            "\"The Little White Horse\" is a fantasy novel for pre-teens and adults by the always surprising Elizabeth Goudge. Originally published by the University of London Press in 1946, with glorious illustrations by C. Walter Hodges, it is  the enchanting story of second chances not only for 13 year-old orphan, Maria Merryweather, who is every bit as spirited as Anne of Green Gables fame, but also Miss Heliotrope and other adults who have lost the love of their lives through personal faults and family vendettas. This edition does not have Hodges's illustrations, but it retains the enchanting plot and wholly original characters like Marmaduke Scarlet, Wiggins, and Loveday Minette.NOTE: I was searching for a horse story as a birthday present for my daughter who adores all things horses. The little white horse has a very small, but pivotal role in the plot--unlike other classic and beloved horse stories like Walter Farley's \"Black Stallion\" or \"Misty of Chincoteague\" by Marguerite Henry.Pair with the delightful movie, \"Secret of Moonacre\".\n",

At age sixteen, Silver takes the Reckoning, a coming-of-age test to decide her place in society. In these uncertain times, no one really knows what happens to the teenagers who disappear into Windsor castle. As soon as Silver sets foot inside, she becomes trapped in a world of suspicion and fear, unable to choose who to trust, or who to fear.Silver, like most girls in dystopian literature, is a free spirit. She doesn&#8217;t think the way the rest of society does, and she&#8217;s not too fond of how society decides things for her. Her best friend is named Colt &#8211; I love that name &#8211; and she constantly pushes the line of what she can and can&#8217;t do. When she gets sent inside Windsor castle along with the other Offerings, she learns the real mening of freedom and choice. She goes through a lot of character development throughout the book, and I loved reading her journey.Reckoning was a decent read, but it felt like a mix of Divergent and The Selection. It didn&#8217;t have a lot of originality. I didn&#8217;t mind that much that the setting didn&#8217;t sound original, but I had hoped the plot would offer more originality. The writing was simplistic, and there&#8217;s no lyrical prose to speak of.

            "Other reviewers have covered the mystery and the romance angles, so I'll skip those parts--which were excellent, in my opinion.You know what I loved the most about this book, the thing that sets it above most of the books I've read lately? It's the heart of the thing, and Ronnie Ingels is the heart. Despite the fact that her job often brings her nose to nose with the worst in human nature, Ronnie still has room to like and trust her fellow man. And despite the differences between her home culture and the culture into which she's dunked in the course of the story, she doesn't come off superior or aloof. She's open to being charmed, and because of that, she charms the reader. If Ronnie had had a different outlook on life, she could have seen the natives as ignorant savages rather than as decent people.The author's bio says she lives in NYC (I forget which part) and, as this is my first Chillemi, I was a bit worried about how she'd present Texas and Texans, so often the butt of hateful jokes. But I worried for naught, because the author brought forward the best--Hoot, Bertha, Thunder, hospitality, innocence, optimism--as well as the worst. I won't name the worst characters, because this is a mystery, after all. Suffice it to say that someone has done murder, and murder in support of other, more profitable crimes. So the criminals exhibit selfishness, greed, dishonesty, and downright cold-heartedness. Still, there are more good, lovable characters than there are despicable ones, and I like that. A whole lot.Rumor has it that there will be more stories for Ronnie and the adorable Dawson Hughes, and let me tell you that I will be on board for those, too.\n",

            "Scholarly, Enlightening, Educational, Mysticism, Profound and Intriguing are some of the words that best describe Author Stanislaw Kapuscinski&#8217;s book, &#8220;The Key to Immortality.&#8221;I have always been an avid reader of The Gospel of Thomas and am constantly in search of books that capture my attention and teach me in the process, especially as they pertain to different Gospels. The Key to Immortality accomplishes both those avenues in a compelling manner that by far outweighs other books discussing the same Gospel.While I am no theologian by any means, I do consider myself to be very profuse and knowledgeable with topics surrounding the bible, especially the New Testament. Most books I have read are cumbersome and not easy to read which don&#8217;t flow well. Perhaps it&#8217;s because I am a layperson thatis why I have not had much luck finding a book in this genre that truly captivates me from the start. That was not the case with &#8220;The Key to Immortality.&#8221; In this book the pages flowed effortlessly and for me I felt as if the words were written in away that everyone could understand and appreciate.Each of the 114 Logia discussed will present a different turn and outlook on things that will take your breath away and have an impact on how you view not only the Gospel of Thomas, but also your own life.In closing this book was mind-blowing experience that I was happy to discuss and add to my library.

In the heat of interstellar battle Kirk orders \"Scotty give me more power\" and Scotty says \"I don't know if I have it but I'll find it\".A straightforward star trek adventure: Klingon bad guy manipulates a war-weary planet to attract enterprise and Kirk so that he can take his revenge upon Kirk for past grievances.An interesting side story too where a woman (the commissioner) who is the product of a dysfunctional family has risen to a position of high authority ends up being driven by her repressed internal conflicts and acts out her self-destructive drives to near interstellar catastrophe.Good star trek and an interesting read.\n",

The devotional is designed for people who have read, and/or seen, _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Hobbit_. The devotionals are short, about 5 or 6 pages each, and compare the Tolkien characters with a Bible character. There are questions for the reader's own life. There's some humor, and the book is designed for junior high, but can be read with profit by any older person interested in Tolkien, and willing to read some Bible with the Tolkien.

            "I would like to say I made a mistake. The editing in the book was not as bad as I said. The word mansome was intended that way. I apologize to the author. Since I took away a point for the editing I gave it back because it wasn't a bad start to a series. Good luck with it :)I wanted to give this book a 5  in the worst way. but I couldn't. I don't know where to start. I really liked the story as a whole. I loved Leo the hero. Alpha ... HOT HOT HOT.  His  buddies Dalton and Roman not so bad either.The author had it set up so you could see things from the hero and heroine's side and I like that.  Its just that the thoughts did not always match what came later in the book. It made you think one thing but it was another. Why would someone think \" I can't tell her this because of this?\" and later the thought wasn't even real?  Avery, our heroine goes with her friend Piper to where her friends brother \"Roman\" works and meets Leo. President of a MC club.  Leo is a super Alpha and Avery isn't sure how to deal with his ways. Not sure of my feeling for the heroine.  She is the type that someone says\" Don't stick your hand in there because a snake will bite\" but she does it anyway and when she gets bit looks at you surprised. There is also something else going on beneath the surface that everyone around her is keeping secret and Avery doesn't know how long she can deal with not being told the truth. It is really the makings of a great story with a few fixes.The Really Bad Stuff::::The editing is horrible. The word \"handsome\" is misspelled  \"mansome\" so many times I had to stop and think about its spelling before I typed it??  Words like soldier were \"solider\". Some sentences did not make sense because wrong words were used, so you had to reread them a couple times to get  it or figure out  who said what.  Avery's last name was Delaney in one place and called Donnelly in another.  I don't so much blame the author. I am getting the impression that they feel in selling us ebooks books at reduced prices that we get what we get..like first drafts. I bet the paperback if there is one doesn't read like this.If they fix up the editing I would 4.5 this book.\n",

It is very well written and set during the Tudor era.Political tensions, power struggles, religion, and magic are all present as Protestants under Queen Mary's rule are forced to covert to Catholicism or be tried for treason and burnt to death.The story is presented by Meg as she serves the exiled Princess Elizabeth. Meg is also trying to hide that she is a witch while at the same time practicing her craft and discovering her emerging powers.The story picks up when a priest and his apprentice Alejandro arrive at Woodstock Palace.From there the story involves many betrayals, accusations, losses, and a building romance. Meg is loyal but not always smart.I really liked WITCHSTRUCK. For a story with such a great plot line I really expected to love it but I didn't connect with the characters as well as I should have.

Carson and his book only furthers that admiration. Though this is a technical book, it was a technical-devotional read for me because it calls for both humility and exegetical fidelity. While reading through the Word Study fallacies I reflected on and was taken back by the extreme care necessary for the process of exegesis. While slogging through the 20 pages of grammatical fallacies I found myself discouraged and swore off the use of my limited language skills forever. The logical fallacies in chapter 3 were the most comfortable for me with some background in rhetoric, it was very helpful. The chapter of Presuppositional and Historical fallacies was also quite helpful as we consider the modern climate which we are ourselves members of, in which we are to interpret a text originating in antiquity.D.A. Carson has never been one known to be particularly gentle but I'm so thankful he concluded his book with this second to last paragraph...&#34;But I do not want to end on so negative a note. There is a danger that readers will conclude their perusal of this little book enslaved to deep fears about their own inadequacies for the task of exegesis. A little self-doubt will do no harm and may do a great deal of good: we will be more open to learn and to correct our mistakes. But too much will shackle and stifle us with deep insecurities and make us so much aware of methods that we may overlook truth itself.&#34; (142)As a non-scholar I am so thankful for the resurgence of evangelical scholarship and consider Dr. Carson to be a leader of this resurgence.

There is nothing clich&eacute; about this murder mystery, though it is written in a charming, old-style classical mystery tone, reminiscent of Agatha Christie and with all the suspense of Daphne du Maurier. The main character, a brilliant detective, is witty, sharp as a tack and quite refreshing and charming.The story line and mystery being solved in this book is a classic &#8220;who killed the rich lady&#8221;. The author kept me guessing around every turn and I liked being kept hanging. The supporting characters and suspects in this mystery were compelling, well-written and delightful.I look forward to reading the further adventures of Jules Poiret.

The protagonist Siria investigates a series of suspicious fires in her neighborhood, and when evidence points to her own friend, Douglas, Siria is aghast. She feels a sense of betrayal because not only is Douglas her best friend, if it is proven that Douglas is the culprit, then he is endangering the life of Siria's beloved father, who is a firefighter.The story moves along, but there are some aspects that befuddled me. How could Siria be gallivanting around town at odd hours without someone supervising her movements and looking out for her safety? Yes, she is motherless and her father is busy with work, but it still seems too far-fetched to be credible. I did like the portrayal of Siria as a courageous young protagonist who is determined to honor her mother's dying wish to look out for her father, a Herculean task for a young girl.

I have met quite a few persons with this problem and when you are with them all you can think about is how they can be helped. To say life for them is not easy is an understatement. When I began reading this book I realized that there are ways to help persons who are troubled with this condition and it gave me hope. I read it all through and I must say I was impressed by the depth of knowledge and understanding the author has shown on the subject. There were things there that I had not known before and it helped me understand better what the disorder was. The steps are very interesting and I have tried a few on some friends of mine who have the disorder and surprisingly they responded well to them. I have not tried everything as yet but I feel it is best to ease into it. This book can be a great help if used in the correct way.

            "The adventures of His Highness' supernatural agents Art, an artificial ghost only a few days old, and her partner Jim, an animated skull, continue. And I couldn't be more pleased. This time, while Art is still recuperating from the re-animationist case, she and Jim must deal with a bone stealer who uses his rather unique gift to remove and insert bones into another and adhere skin, muscle, tissue, and nerves without permanent damage - except to the one who unwillingly donates his or her bones.I was delighted by the first book in this series. (Read my review of Risen here.) So, I was expecting to enjoy Bones as well. What I was not expecting was to absolutely fall in love with it! From the artwork to character development to the beautiful Victorian London scenes, it was impossible not to love this novel.I know Elizabeth Watasin did a great deal of research for this novel, but I have a feeling that she actually lives and breathes this era, that she sees airships when she looks up and carts and hansom cabs on cobblestone roads when she looks around.The pace was perfect. We get to know more of not only Art and Jim, but the other characters as well. I was surprised, however, when the conclusion of the bone stealer case is revealed, for it seemed too soon. But, it made room for us to get to know some of the characters even better when they are not under the pressure of solving a case. And for that I'm grateful.I admit I am most fascinated by Jim Dastard. As an animated skull with phantom limbs, his manner of speaking is honest and, at times, funny, once referring to Art's &#34;Quaker tantrum.&#34; I was especially amused by the nausea in his phantom organs, and subsequent vomiting of coins, cigarettes, tobacco, and the like.The introduction of Delphia, Jim's new &#34;legs&#34; was an enjoyable addition to this novel. She impressed me with her bravery and open mind to the Vesta and its occupants.And speaking of the Vesta, one of the things that is most pleasing about The Dark Victorian series is the acceptance of unconventional relationships. While Art and Jim, two supernatural creatures, find not only acceptance, but friendship, among the staff and residents of the Vesta, it is equally satisfying that the other residents live without &#34;community condemnation or social judgment.&#34;Fans of steampunk will revel in the culture that is The Dark Victorian, while fans of fantasy will enjoy a good mystery laden with supernatural fantasy.I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.\n",

However, I had faith after reading Open Minds by the same author that Ms. Quinn would come through. And yes she did!First, the setting is so unique, even for a steampunk novel. The blurb is NOT lying when it describes the story as 'steampunk goes to Bollywood.' That is really what it felt like! I haven't read a book with such a cool setting in a long time.Secondly, I loved Ash and Aniri! They were both great characters. Aniri is a main character that you can't help but like; she's brave even when it is hard to be, she's a bit flawed, and she doesn't wait for people to do things for her, she does them herself. Ash has a bit of a Prince Maxon flair &agrave; la the Selection, which is partially why I enjoyed reading about him so much. He is a very enjoyable character as well.The story is NOT predictable, and that's something I just love! No matter if you think you've totally gotten it figured out, you never have until the very end. The author hints something will happen, and then she's like, &#34;Nope, that's not right! Think again, readers!&#34;Definitely something I would recommend. It's a very fun book, and I loved every minute of it!\n",

            "Mrs. Richmond's learning approach in this Spanish Vocabulary book is excellent, but she indulges in writing about moral issues that serious-minded Christians would find repulsive... which greatly mars this volume for me.In workbook format, this volume starts with the alphabet and pronunciation basics, good for beginners and good to review for those who have forgotten Spanish from high school days, but it moves quickly into grammar.A GREAT bonus with this workbook is the answer key at the back, a very practical help for those who are independent learners.Dorothy Richmond's methodology is geared for practice, but in such a way as to make the learning delightful, like a table game ( in small steps ) that helps the learner to REMEMBER it.When teaching \"Yo soy... \" ( I am , which is used for an UNchangeable \"to be\" condition ) , she omits the explanation and replaces it with amusing and interesting sentences in which the learner must use YO SOY several times ... and will remember the condition too !For instance, to teach YO SOY  and DE ( of )  , she would say something like this, in Spanish:I am LA AMIGA ( the female friend ) DE  Mickey Mouse. ( So, who am I ? )The LEARNER responds on the exercise sheet: Yo soy Senorita Minnie.Thus, the learner practices reading YO SOY  ... DE....  and writing YO SOY ( son, daughter, friend, etc.).... using YO SOY in UNchangeable conditions !So, the exercises are fun, interesting, and entertaining. No drudgery whatsoever with doing Mrs. Richmond's exercises.The exercises include interesting facts from many popular areas:  sports, entertainment, current events, historical events, etc.However.......  being a serious-minded Christian, I winced at some of the afore-mentioned items she has put before her students' eyes. She makes references regarding Harry Potter as easily as she does  Adam and Cain and Abel. She has many \"interesting\" exercise sentences which include homosexuals and \"their\" off-spring ( ?).She makes reference to husbands and wives and their \"ex's\"... yes , all a part of the sad reality of western civilization,  but do these unsavory and ungodly and sorrowful situations need to be put before a student's eyes as though the situations were NORMAL ?The students from broken homes whom I have taught during my teaching years were never at peace about their sorrowful situation with one ( or both ! ) parent /s  missing.  Something ALWAYS seemed missing from their lives and they looked yearningly upon the \"other kids\" who had NORMAL homes, with a Mom and Dad.For any such student who is from a broken home, or is the off-spring of an illicit affair, such reminders of the sorrow of their lives seem totally un-necessary and really, out of place in a language study book.Surely, there are enough clean-living personalities who are sufficiently well-known  that Mrs. Richmond and her student helpers COULD have chosen to omit the seamier side of life, just for once.How about Joan Woodard and Paul Newman, for starters, in the entertainment world ?( I cannot recall any clean-livers in the current political world, at the moment, but there might be some... )It so distracts from the intrinsic worth of the volume, that I am sad I purchased it.... and sadder that such a promising volume would be un-fit for Christians to learn an amoral subject like the Spanish language.It is a SAD commentary on the academia in this civilization who have allowed such \"realities\" of the unclean, baser side of life to darken, deaden, and clutter the learning resources, exercise books, and text books of this age... all  of which are put before the impressionable minds and hearts of the learners.Clean is BETTER.Yours for an un-reproachable conscience before GOD and man...Sr. Judith Hannah  + + +\n",

            "Eleanor Catton, a native of New Zealand, was the youngest person yet, at 27, to have been awarded the Man Booker Prize. &#34;The Luminaries&#34; is the second of Ms Catton's novels. At 832 pages, it is a comprehensive work.The story takes place in 1866 in the gold fields of New Zealand. It is at once an engaging mystery and at the same time a weaving soap opera evolving numerous characters. To Ms Catton's credit she manages to keep the character development so well done that she supports her otherwise lengthy saga in a way that strings the reader along.In short the story details a mystery....who killed Crosby Wells, why was Anna found unconscious at the side of the road and what happened to Emery Stains?All in all the story is pretty good. The character development is excellent and the writing style wholly readable, which will appeal to a wide audience. On the negative side, and the main reason for a slightly lesser rating, comes the ending. The end of the book and the end of the tale seems to fall flat.....the reader is left wondering what happened after being engaged for  830 pages.Not withstanding my disappointment at the conclusion, I would non the less recommend you add this book to your reading list, and rate it memorable.\n",

            "I loved this book!  The characters were all believable and I was surprised to find out who was involved (though I did suspect one, and i think the author made it very clear).  I was surprised to find that some I suspected weren't involved.The mystery:Lydia's husband had died in the fire that had been set to their house.  She had managed to get her son out but not her husband.  Her husband had a lot of secrets, but those secrets obviously hadn't died with him.  Now somebody was after her son, and Lydia escaped to an island hoping to keep him safe.  But when she met the chief security guard, she had all kinds of problems.  There was lots of suspense.  Lots of twists and turns occurred, which kept me reading.I loved the ending storm and all the mystery it entailed.  I thought the author did an excellent job in writing a detailed and edgy scene that kept me reading, wondering how it was all going to end!The romance:It didn't happen fast.  Slowly, the romance developed between the two.  They gave into their emotions and shared a kiss.  It's always refreshing when the couple doesn't wait until the very end and suddenly they are in love.  A man being a true hero for the woman he loved.  The romance was very sweet!Spiritual aspects:Excellent!  Lydia had lost her faith due to things that had happened in her recent past.  But as the book progressed, she began to see that Matt was right.There were so many aspects to this story.  I loved all the characters and trying to figure out who was guilty or innocent!  The author did an excellent job on this story!Oh, by the way:  I am a librarian, so I'll say it:  Bad, bad librarian!

            "Wow! I loved this book. I read this first before My Savior Forever and Together Forever. The sexy hot cover model Rob Anthony, caught my eye so I had to read it. Now that I have read this I HAVE TO READ THE OTHER 2 BOOKS OF THE SERIES!!  Yep it was that good!The story is about Paxton Davenport. She comes from a very wealthy backgorund. She is a beautiful model. She has beautiful long blonde hair and  natural highlights that everyone wants their hair like hers. She has a set of parents that want nothing to do with her unless its to further their own needs in their own social standings. Her parents have never really treated her like their child. They were always gone and so Jonesy became more her father than her own. She has a hair stylist, Marcus, that is gayer than gay and has the best sense of humor. Her best friend Allie has just recently married her best friend Shane back in Kansas. Shane owns the bar he works at and is also a member of the Band Razers Edge along with Tucker Williams.Tucker Williams has had a rough life. Grew up with &#34;druggie&#34; parents and his father died of a drug overdose. His mother was sent to prison for her role in the drugs. He met up with a bad drug dealer,Darndage, and helped to send the man away to prison. From then on he has decided to clean his life up and work with Shane as a tattoo artist and designer and is in the band with Shane. Razers Edge.Tucker can be cocky as hell and hes HOT! The tatoos's on his muscular arms and his shoulder length black hair and has every woman after him in a fifty mile radius.&#34;Pax&#34; met this &#34;hot sexy rocker&#34; dude at Allies wedding. Everyman she has ever know has always wanted nothing but to have her &#34;V-card. She isnt about to give it up til she meets a man that will love her, cherish her and protect her and be her Soul Mate! And Tucker is bound and determined to be her Soul Mate.Tucker met Paxton at his best mates wedding and has his eyes set on Paxton, his &#34;Beauty. He has tried to get her attention and Paxton isnt  about to let the thick walls she has built around her heart.Will Paxton ever let her walls down for Tucker, a sexy hot rocker? You gotta read this! Will Tucker ever get his &#34;beauty? You have to  read this!! You have to read the story between Tucker and Paxton how their love holds them together thru all the bad things they endure together.My favorite quote from the book, &#34;Please make me a women tonight. Make me your woman. You have my heart, now take my soul.&#34;That quote alone should make you want to read this book. Loved the sex in the book. Its so hot and erotic.I gave this 5 stars for the love I felt between Tucker and Paxton. Tucker is so absorbed with Paxton and is the sweetest man walking and cherishes her dearly. She is his Soul Mate Forever. Paxton is so overwhelmed for the love she has for Tucker, her sexy rocker, her Soul Mate Forever.  The story is so erotic and so full of love between them. I loved it!!  Soul Mates Forever can be read as a stand alone novel but I plan on reading the first 2 books of the series to get a better feel for their friends and a feel for the love everyone shares in the story. If you want to read a story about a Beauty and a sexy hot rocker dude. This is it!!\n",

She is now a Professor of Law at Hofstra Law School, where she teaches criminal law and procedure.  So, I&#8217;m really surprised that she based her latest novel, &#8220;All Day and a Night,&#8221; on a completely unrealistic legal premise.&#8220;All Day and a Night&#8221; refers to a man serving a sentence of life without parole - &#8220;all day and a night&#8221; in jail jargon.  He was suspected of five murders but pled guilty and was convicted of only one.  That murder had a  &#8220;signature&#8221; of bones broken after the victim&#8217;s death.After the convict has served 18 years, another murder is committed with the same &#8220;signature.  The police assign two detectives to reopen the investigation into all the murders.  Meanwhile, the convict gets a publicity-hungry lawyer who convinces a State court in one hearing to release him. Within hours, the convict is free, with no motions, no conditions, no review.  When does that happen in the real world?This story continues with more irrational elements.  Other than that, the novel is a nice work of fiction: good writing; fine character development; good mystery.  Just suspend reality and enjoy it.\n",

She put a lot into the character development of Aaron/Remi and Willow, which was great.  There were some real contradictory issues with Willow's obsession with God and the Ten Commandments that gave me pause at times.  Also there was one major &#34;What the heck..?&#34; moment for me where the story took a major turn, but things just didn't add up, and I felt like it was written in as a way to keep things moving along in the story, but it was too major and there was a GLARING issue with it.  (Sorry - don't want to give it away.)  Overall, it was a fun adult paranormal read.  I will probably eventually read the next in the series, because I am curious about what is in store for each of the characters...\n",

However, that doesn't mean their bodies didn't mold well together...From beginning to end, Anna and Nick were taking bites off each other's heads. There was no apparent warmth between them. Only the two of them knew that deep down, they deeply care about each other.This book was quite serious and heavy in conflict. I liked it, but there wasn't enough romance for me. I liked that they both were willing to protect each other no matter the cost. However, it was a bit predictable. There also wasn't enough humor in the story to lighten it up a bit. Nick was always grumpy and Anna was always hiding behind her wall. Even when they have monkey sex together, they still weren't one. The scene below was one of the only funny scenes I remembered.Overall, the story was good. It's worth a read if you have nothing else to do on a weekend.

            "From his cell, the narrator of The Enchanted tells us the story of the inmates, guards and other inhabitants of the ancient stone prison where he is being held on death row. Through his sometimes almost supernatural sight, he tells us of the Lady, an investigator hired by lawyers to try and get death row inmates out of their death sentences, the Fallen Priest, who struggles to make sense of the tragedy that caused his fall from grace, the warden whose wife is fighting a losing battle against cancer, and York, a brutal killer with a heartbreaking past of his own. As his own execution draws closer, the narrator draws all of these characters together in the enchanted place where wild horses run...An Amazon pick of the month, The Enchanted has received quite a lot of attention in the past couple of months. After reading the blurb, and hearing the comparisons to such great books as The Green Mile, I added it to my To-Read list, unsure quite what to expect but looking forward to discovering what it was all about. What I found was a heart-wrenching literary fantasy, definitely worthy of the positive vibes that have been rippling through the blogosphere recently.Told by a nameless narrator - whose identity is hinted at throughout but not fully revealed until the very end - The Enchanted brings together a number of disparate characters, all of them with dark secrets in their pasts, all of them struggling to make sense of the world around them and such concepts as justice, forgiveness and morality in a place where morals are a commodity and not a necessity. As our narrator skips between the characters, we get a fully rounded glimpse into the enchanted place that is this prison: a dark place where guards turn a blind eye to murder and rape in return for drug-money kickbacks, but also an enchanted place where the slightest act of goodwill can shine like a star gone suddenly nova.Combining fantastical elements with a harrowing examination of the penal system and an investigative subplot surrounding the Lady and her attempts to see York escape the death penalty, the novel is able to constantly surprise and astonish, drawing out revelations about characters that turn monsters into victims without shying away from the dark truths. While examining something as sensitive as the death sentence and the way we treat men and women in prison, The Enchanted never goes for the easy answer or the simple emotion, forcing the reader to make their own minds up or at least go away from the book asking themselves questions.Denfeld's writing combines short, sharp sentences with a poetic turn of phrase at times that culminates in a final scene that I defy anyone to read without at least a lump in their throat. Told mainly in the first person, the story moves skillfully between the characters, giving them all space to breath and develop despite the short length. While there are a few truly villainous characters (one each especially amongst the guards and the prisoners), most of them are far from simply cardboard cutouts - every single one of them has a story to tell.The ending is bitter sweet, depending on the characters, but most of the story questions posed by the novel are answered while the more philosophical conundrums are left - as I said above - to the reader to make sense of. The fantastical elements, while present, are left in the background and again it is left up to the reader to decide how much of them are real and how much of them are wish fulfillment on the part of the narrator.Harrowing and yet uplifting, dark and yet full of hope, The Enchanted is one of my books of the year so far and I imagine that it will be somewhere in my top ten by the end. Filled with real people and brimming over with beautiful, dark imagery, the book is a thought provoking novel that doesn't forget that the first job of any novel is to tell a story. I will most definitely be looking out for Rene Denfeld's next work. I gave The Enchanted 5 flibber-gibbets out of 5.\n",

            "This series caught me by surprise, as I tried it without knowing anything about it. I instantly felt drawn to Flavia, as even though she is hardly credible as a preteen girl, she is totally believable as a character. Her passion for chemistry and her glee in mulling over the famous chemists of the past is a master-stroke. Her loneliness and &#34;difference&#34; is magnified at every turn, by the dreary post-war years, the family dysfunction, and the lack on companionship. I find Flavia's fondness for her bicycle very touching. My only caveat is that sometimes the author drags in other female characters who don't really add to the story, such as the gypsy girl. Hanging out in Flavia's bedroom isn't compelling.Otherwise, a lovely discovery. I hope younger readers will get into Flavia, she is a great character who promises to endure.\n",

            "If I had not known ahead of time that this was juvenile fiction, I might not have guessed by reading it. The book is longer than most Christian juvenile fiction novels, and it is written more on an adult level. The main character is 12 years old at the beginning of the book, but is 20-21 years old by the end of the book, so the main character is an adult for most of the book.To be honest, the only reason I picked the book to review was because there weren't many selections available for review at the time from the publisher. Of what was available, it sounded the most promising, but would not have been a book I would normally have picked up to read. But if far exceeded my expectations.The author created a great and likable character in Drew, the main character of the book. All through the book, he has struggles and doubts about God, which I can relate to, and is intent on doing the right thing, even when it isn't popular.The idea of the book is that due to an accident that temporarily blinds him, Drew is able to see what he believes to be alien invaders all over, who are trying to wreck havoc on people. No one else can see them but Drew, and he soon finds himself running for his life from these dark beings.I won't give too much away, but will say I caught on fairly early what these dark beings were, and found myself enjoying the story a lot. I had intended to read part of it and finish it another day, but I got into the story so much that I finished it in one sitting. This may be a book geared for juvenile readers, but I loved it. The ending, not so much, as I hate cliff-hanger endings, and it left me hoping that book two comes out soon.I definitely recommend it for teen readers, especially boys, but a lot of adults will enjoy it also.\n",

He never tries to screw buyers over and will sell them the best car for their buck. Lance has his own code of ethics.Lance is also a liar par excellance. He can tell a lie better than anyone and have everyone believing that lie. He's lied his whole life and the practice has made his life easier. Lance can fit in anywhere and his lies help him get there.Lance also has a photographic memory and a little out of body thing goin on.When he's out of body he can float above himself and any alititude, catch a clue about whats going on in the area, and make a decision on how to proceed. Pretty handly little ability to have especially when the CIA takes over his life.Lance filled out a questionaire he got in college. The questionaire was looking for folks interested in joining the Foreign Service. Lance filled in out, sent it in and promptly forgot about it.Lance was mildly surprised to be picked for testing. Lance, true to form, put down nothing but lies on the entire questionaire. A questionaire that will change his life.So begins one damned fine read.This one has Lance, his time in the Army, his training, his comrades in arms, his boss, his boss's agenda, a girl named Marta, jihadists, the KGB, loads of bad guys and Preacher pulling it off.Just one great read and well worth those five stars.\n",

Eve is up for promotion at the magazine she works for and needs to do a piece on Wild West Brides, a sort-of mail order bride business, run by oh-so-hot Ted. She goes to them 'undercover' and her first challenge is to ride a horse - LOL! poor girl. As we get to know Ted we find he has his own past and stumbling blocks to deal with. The twists and turns getting these two together make for a good read.  Enjoy!\n",

I won&#8217;t delve on the technical details of the book but I can assure you this is the first help I got right after deciding on making some changes with my finances. As the book suggested in its first page, it is best to know what your current financial status is to be able to make adjustments based on that fact. Your goal and purpose should also be clear to you. I highly recommend this book!\n",

            "I was gifted a copy of this book for an honest review. I was interested in the messages different types of flowers could send. I will say, it started out a little weak, but it didn&#8217;t take too long to pull me in to where I had to make myself put it down to go to bed.Georgina knows flowers. She&#8217;s always loved them and even makes her living as a florist. Therefore, she becomes intrigued when flowers begin mysteriously showing up on her doorstep. She knows the meaning of each of the flowers, but is unsure of what her secret messenger is trying to tell her. It seems sweet and innocent until ominous flowers begin showing up along with the loving ones. She&#8217;s trying to figure out the mystery behind the flowers, but with all the drama going on in her life, she&#8217;s having a hard time focusing on the message. Between the return of her high school crush, Corbin, and the jealousy his return inducing in her best friend and employee, Sid; Georgina&#8217;s world is spinning out of control, and she doesn&#8217;t know how to get it back to normal.Corbin is the only man Georgina has ever truly wanted, but he&#8217;s never seemed to return her affections. When he suddenly returns and begins to pursue her, she&#8217;s taken aback. She tries to keep her guard up, but she can&#8217;t help falling for him again. When it comes to a man that sexy AND sweet, what sensible girl could resist? But Corbin has some secrets that threaten to destroy the relationship they&#8217;ve built. Will Georgina be able to forgive his lies, or will she lose the only man she&#8217;s ever loved once again? And don&#8217;t forget about Sid and his irrational behavior. Is he the secret flower messenger and trying to win Georgina over, or is he out to sabotage her and her new relationship with Corbin? Who can Georgina really trust? Buy this book and find out.As I mentioned, the story started out a little weak in my opinion, but don&#8217;t give up on it. It gets really good and is well worth plowing through the beginning. There are some grammar and punctuation issue, but they aren&#8217;t severe enough to affect the comfortable reading of the story. If you like a love story with some added suspense, I definitely recommend this book. It was an enjoyable read, and I would read other books by this author in the future.\n",

He had been given her info by her sister the weekend prior.  The story follows their first meeting and night together.Night after Night (book 1) is the continuation for Clay and Julia&#8217;s steamy night together.  Clay is back in New York, but neither is ready to let go just yet so they book a weekend trip for Julia to visit Clay  Julia is torn as she has this big secret she can&#8217;t disclose which prevents her from being in a relationship.  Clay healed, but with lessons learned from a bad relationship is set on honesty and full disclosure.So while they are extremely compatible in bedroom with the sex is off-the-charts and their conversations/bantering on queue their agendas are not attuned.

He is boyfriend material and a keeper.  Seven words to describe Clay: Charismatic, honest, commanding, flexible, confident, noble and open-minded.JULIA BELL, JULES: ~25 years/bartender/reddish-brown hair/green eyes.Unfortunately Julia Bell disappointed me in this story. In the prelude her keeping secrets came across as evasive yet necessary in a playful way.  But in book 1 Clay opens up about his past and makes it clear that honesty is everything to him and though I understand some of her reasoning (though  over-dramatized) I feel she should have revaluated and come up with a better solution to be worthy of Clay.Seven words to describe Julia: Selfish, misguided, secretive, assured, strong, focused, non-committal and spontaneous.Night after Night offered lots of steamy and playful sex, but story also allowed for the plot and the dialogue to develop.  As mentioned Julia failed me (Clay), but I am hoping she will redeem herself in book 3.  Story ends with a huge cliffy and so I am looking forward to book 2, After this Night for the conclusion of their story.Off-the-charts smut!  Sexy and memorable hero!

            "I cannot say enough good about this book. I was desperate to get my 2 year old to eat something other than chicken nuggets and noodles but was skeptical that he would try any of these. He is very suspicious of new foods and anything that is made a little different. For example, a quesadilla with cheese is ok, but add anything in there and he freaks. So I was skeptical of the zucchini quesadilla recipe but tried it. He ate 3 slices. I have cooked something from this book for breakfast and dinner for the past two weeks. He has eaten every recipe except one or two.Some of the reviews say that the changes are too basic and everyone knows them, but I had no idea how to make regular dishes into something he would enjoy. Every dish is made to cater to children with strict tastes, so I know something won't taste weird or too strong. We have also enjoyed the recipes, so I don't have to make two different meals.Another good point: Alot of the recipes use the same ingredients, so I just needed to stock my pantry and fridge with some staples instead of having to buy new ingredients for each recipe. I also like comments from moms about how to change up the recipes, which is one downside to paper cookbooks - not being able to read the comments on how people have changed ingredients.My only complaint is that in the past two weeks, I have spent a huge amount of time in the kitchen. It seems like these recipes are very time consuming, even though there will be a comment about how quick they are. But if I need to chop a bunch of stuff and puree some other stuff, then assemble it, that takes time, which takes time away from being with my child who is too young to help for longer than a couple of minutes. I will have to do alot of prep at night when he is in bed in order to make it work for the long term.However, I feel better than I have in a while from eating these meals, and I notice tantrums and snacking have decreased. I had never seen their blog but looked it up and found that all of these recipes and more are on their blog for free, so if you want to check them out before you buy the book, you can. Or you might just save your money and use the web, but I like having a cookbook in front of me versus a computer.\n",

Sister Reader passed out papers to all the sisters that read, &#34;What did you think of during the sacrament?&#34;  That sentence really made me think.  Usually I read the scriptures during the sacrament, but did I truly think about the Savior and the importance of the sacrament?  The next day at Family Home Evening, I was inspired to give a lesson about the sacrament.  We read this lovely book together as a family and used the lovely experience of the author to better our understanding of the sacrament and the importance of partaking it every week.  Also to encourage my family to be spiritually prepared to take the sacrament, and to be thinking of Jesus Christ, through prayer and the scriptures.My family and I will cherish this book and I am very grateful that it is in our home.\n",

            "This book is a hot mess and is really hard to rate.  The writing was very awkward and confusing.  It sounded to me like it was written by a group of high school girls but then I saw the writer was only 22 so guess that explains it.  There were so many things going on that caused me to scratch my head, thinking &#34;who does that?&#34;.  You expected one of the characters to react a certain way in a situation but their reaction would be something totally different that didn't make sense.  The dialog was off too - how many 18 year-old girls who live in a trailer with a stripper for a mother say &#34;whilst&#34; and &#34;amongst&#34;?  All the long, heartfelt declarations of love with her father and stepmother got really old so I just started skimming those.  It felt like &#34;how do I love thee, let me count the ways&#34;!The editing was probably the worst I've ever read and I read 6 - 7 novels a week.  Spelling errors, crazy punctuation, run-on sentences, extra words, missing words, incomplete sentences, grammar mistakes, you name it, this book had it.  And it wasn't like one error per page or something, it was multiple errors in each sentence.  I lost count of how many times I had to edit a sentence several different ways in my head just to figure out what was going on.Harley was the biggest mess of all.  That chick seriously needed to stay single and focus on growing up.  The fact that every time one of the guys cheated on her she wondered if it was her fault was so incredibly annoying.  Even more annoying was how quickly she would take them back, especially Jace.All that being said, I still couldn't put this book down.  I think it had the same appeal that a show like &#34;worlds fattest man&#34; or &#34;woman with three heads&#34; has - you don't want to look but something just draws you in, some sick fascination you can't resist.

            "Unlike Hulk Gray, which explores unrecorded moments between point A and point B in the first day of the Incredible Hulk&#8217;s existence, Spiderman Blue is really just about Peter Parker narrating memories of Gwen Stacy and a recounting of brief, early battles with classic enemies of Spider-man (the Green Goblin, Rhino, the Lizard, Vulture and Kraven the Hunter). The story is not really so great, and the character development not so awesome either &#8211; it shows Peter spending more time with Mary Jane than it does of him starting up his relationship with Gwen.  But the art is great &#8211; cool shots of Spider-man swinging around the city, usually in some sort of &#8220;classic&#8221; pose you&#8217;d credit to John Romita Sr than to a modern artist. The fashions are funky, and there are not too many tedious scenes with Aunt May or J Jonah Jameson; the classic encounter with Mary Jane is not terribly impressive (too hard to out-do the original), but at least there are plenty of large panels, and tons of one-page and two-page spreads. Love it!! We also get to see more of Peter&#8217;s motorcycle, moving out of Aunt May&#8217;s house to become Harry Osborn&#8217;s roommate, Flash joining the army, all well-treaded stuff.Probably the most dramatic point of this book is the striking covers that Tim Sale comes up with, seemingly inspired by Reid Miles&#8217; work for Blue Note jazz records and mid-sixties pop art (there&#8217;s also a funny anecdote related in the end-interview/sketches pages &#8211; nice stuff here &#8211; that talks about how Tim was campaigning to put Aunt May on one of the covers instead of Gwen or Mary Jane!!!! Thankfully that never happened. The art is big and bold and full of dramatic colours, expressive faces, but also clear homage&#8217;s to Frank Miller or the John Romitas (Senior and Junior). The fashions are great, and they just go on and on. Funky wear-a-mustache milk-drinking breakfast scene in Aunt May&#8217;s house. Wellll&#8230; maybe not that funky&#8230; A very bad after shave joke. Mary Jane serving soup! Gwen reading Huckleberry Finn!Love the sound effects: Bdif! Squash! Floosh! Snatch (when something is snatched)! Wwok! Krash! Plooph! Dkush! Sllak! Flak! Bdok! Skrip! Thrash! Plk! Swak (a kissing sound)! Wrok! Wram! BDFF!

I really liked Symon and his patience and strength when interacting with Elena. As for Elena, she was torn between doing what was right and wanting to be as normal as she could. She could have trusted Symon way sooner because it got old having to read about her second guessing him when it was clear he was one who could be trusted.What I didn't care for was the author's frequent explanations and insertions into the story about the characters feelings. It felt forced. The interactions between the characters was enough to keep the story moving without all the extra.This was in a set of Five Unforgettable Knights and I had never read this author before. I don't buy into the healing processes Elena used and would typically not read books like this, but since the description didn't mention anything about it, I didn't consider that when I gave it three stars.\n",

            "One day, maybe over coffee, several of the greatest romance authors of today got together and decided to write a series of books based upon the myth of the Arabian Nights and Scheherazade. Each month a different bestselling author will write a new novella resulting in the brilliant collection 1001 Dark Nights.The first installment in this delicious collection is Forever Wicked by Shayla Black. Forever Wicked is part of Ms. Black&#8217;s Wicked Lovers series and introduces us to Jason Denning and Gia Angelotti. Jason and Gia first met at Club Dominion where Jason served as Gia&#8217;s Dom. The two stole away to Vegas to get married but then tragedy occurred. Before they could enjoy more than one day of their married life, Gia&#8217;s brother was killed in the line of duty. Gia immediately rushed home to care for her depressed sister-in-law and her children, as well as her grieving parents. A police officer herself, Gia thought she didn&#8217;t need Jason&#8217;s help and could handle everything by herself. She pushed Jason out of her heart and her life.Fast forward one year later and Jason is determined to make one last ditch effort at saving his marriage. He blackmails Gia into spending time with him and allowing him the chance to win her back. What follows is a heart-warming story as Gia is reminded why she fell in love with Jason and learns to allow herself to lean on her husband.Gia is a fascinating character. It&#8217;s not often you see a police officer being submissive but I understood completely Gia&#8217;s need to let go and allow someone else to be the strong one. Family is a huge part of her life and her need to care for and help others has caused her to forget about her own wants and needs in her quest to be who and what her family needs.Jason is a Dom who only wants to take care of and support his wife. He&#8217;s also a billionaire who was raised by a mother who doesn&#8217;t know the first thing about love unless there is a financial payoff. Jason knows that he cares deeply for Gia and wants to take care of her but as to love? That&#8217;s something found only in romance novels.Forever Wicked broke my heart and then put it all back together with a big red bow. The death of Gia&#8217;s brother and the effect on the family created such heartache. Yet watching Jason caring for Gia and trying to solve all of her problems inspired me. Watching the two fall in love with each other all over again? Priceless! Ms. Black has a gift of creating characters who become so real that their pain is your pain and their triumphs are yours.If you are a fan of Ms. Black&#8217;s Wicked Lovers series, and you should be, then you know that the sex scenes are going to be hot, I mean off the charts hot! And Ms. Black was able to pack a lot of heat in a small amount of pages. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever think about chocolate mousse the same way again.If Forever Wicked is the standard set for the 1001 Dark Nights collection then I think us readers are very lucky. I can&#8217;t wait for next month and the next installment. Here&#8217;s to more collaboration in the future!\n",

            "Hattie was a young girl when she moved to Philadelphia with her mother and sisters. Marrying young, she ultimately had eleven children. Her adult life and relationships with her children were colored by the deaths of her first two children, twins who died of influenza or pneumonia.  Hattie never recovered from their deaths, which turned her into a severe and critical woman who wasn't able to experience joy or express the love she felt for her other children. The Twelve Tribes of Hattie recounts the stories of each of her remaining children, many of whom suffered from mental illness and depression.Author Ayana Mathis explores the effects of tragedy, mental illness, depression, and poverty on a family struggling to get by in this book set from the 1920s through 1980. Ultimately, Hattie understands how she has failed her family, and resolves not to do so again when Hattie's daughter Cassie succumbs to mental illness and leaves her daughter Sala in Hattie's care.  It's well-written and compulsively readable, although I found the unending progression of sad and tragic stories hard to bear. Nevertheless, it provides much food for thought and discussion. This would be a good choice for book clubs and anyone else who enjoys contemporary fiction.\n",

            "Originally, I got this book because it sounded like a bubbly story of a boy with depression. I think that is very accurate of the book. The book was wonderfully written. One of the best aspects of it was how relatable it was. You may wonder how you a mentally stable person could relate; the relating came through being stuck in a cycle. In the book, Craig just got stuck and he did not see an outlet out of his life. Though it meant tearing down his previous life, Craig  found a way out which would make him a hero to most people. Not only is this story heartwarming in the sense that the main character got his life back together, it gives us hope for our own lives.Though your life may not be the best, this book will surely remind you of how lucky you are and the importance of appreciating your current life. I was thoroughly impressed with the complex thought provoking nature achieved through this book. Though written very comically and lighthearted, It&#8217;s Kind of a Funny Story teaches you to respect those with depression and gives more of an understanding.Noted at the back of the book is the information that this book was written soon after the author got out of a mental hospital himself. This really gives even more perspective when reading it. I wish I had known while reading the book.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a comical story of hope. This book is not just for teens. Many adults could gain insight and enjoy this book.\n",

I just didn't ever get a feel for the characters. I never really felt their personality. They could have been anyone. They also seemed much younger to me. I was very surprised when they said they were in their 20's (one even late 20's)! This story was also written in first person - so it is kind of harder to build the character that way in the first place. I didn't warm up to the characters at all.All-in-all this was &#34;middle of the road&#34; for me, not bad but not great. I will continue reading and reviewing the other two books in the series. The storyline was interesting enough for me to want to continue to read more. A big plus was that it was a fast moving book and had enough happening to keep it interesting.\n",

            "I had a hard time with this one.  It seemed the whole first part of the book (that I read) was in her head with her commenting to herself.  She seemed awfully immature for her age and experience.  I couldn't figure the Aunt's age.  At first I thought she was quite a bit older than the niece, then she seemed to be just a few years older than the niece then I wonder why in heck she let her Aunt tell her what to do and when to do it.  She is a grown woman and she is told to come inside and not talk to the cowboy, her old friend. Really?  I didn't get that.Then she gets up to go outside and have it out with a rooster her first morning home.  Really?  that just seemed dumb.  I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on.  I met the hero and it seemed like the aunt did something to come between him and the heroine but the heroine has no idea what she did.  I think.  I finally gave up on this one and quit reading.  I did go back and read some reviews before writing mine and discovered a few were as confused as I was.  They did get further in the book than I did.  This really sounded like a mixed up group of people and the vodka soaked aunt needed to be tossed off a cliff.read for yourself and see what you think.

            "I am a sucker for small town stories as I grew up in one. This book has the authentic small town feeling with the predictable small town people. There are always those who stay, those who go away, those who &#34;make&#34; it and those who don't. That's the way it is. I guess what makes this different is that the character, Lee, is based on a real life friendship the author has with Bon Iver. I don't know the group so that made little difference to me.This little town is in Wisconsin and is told from the viewpoint of five people- the married couple, Henry and Beth who stayed; the rodeo star, Ronny, who is injured and returns home; Kip who makes a nice living in Chicago and comes home to rejuvenate his hometown and Lee, the major rock star who can't cut his roots. The idea that no matter where you are in life you are still most comfortable with the people you grew up with is an idea that I agree with. At age 61 when I am with my childhood friends it is as if no time has passed.  After all, they know all about you. They know your families and your secrets.This book would have been better if they had explored that relationship more. The best part of the book was when Lee spent the night at Ronny's before Henry and Beth's wedding. The interaction with Ronny's father was so perfect and so telling. There just wasn't enough of those moments.  I think it revolved too much around the hero worship of Lee.  Yes, it's wonderful that he's famous and comes home again. If Lee is based on Bon Iver then I suppose Henry is based on the author. That may be why Henry came out too perfect and one dimensional. He didn't ring true.The ending was absurd.  It really spoiled the book for me. The incident was unlikely and the bro-romance was over the top. While the writing was good, the ending dropped my rating to three stars. It could have been so much better.\n",

            "Afterparty ended up being one of those books that I thought was one thing, but turned out to be something else, entirely.  The writing and dialogue in this book charmed me, and while I know it won&#8217;t be for everyone, I thought that Emma&#8217;s inner dialogue and sense of humor brought a lot to the story.  I liked Emma, and I could relate to her, so I guess I was drawn in by her obvious need to get out from her her father&#8217;s watchful eye and her strong inner conscience that with which she is always at war.  Her move to LA is ushered in with a kiss from a stranger at a beach club, which seemed strange at the time, but really set the tone for what Emma would experience in her new home.  The income level and lifestyle of the teens at Emma&#8217;s new school is not one that many of the readers will have first hand experience with, but I thought the book did a good job of showing how the wealth and privilege most certainly did not buy happiness for anyone. Another standout for me was the presence of a single parent that did not just disappear.  So often in YA it seems that the single parent dynamic is used an an excuse to eliminate all adult oversight, but Emma&#8217;s father, while perhaps a bit naive at times, did not fade into the background, and I appreciated that because I think it really gave me a good idea of Emma&#8217;s character and the inner conflict she was experiencing.Afterparty was dramatic, and there was a certain guilty pleasure aspect to the story, but this book was also about Emma struggle with who she is.  It wasn&#8217;t just the usual, I am a teen and must test boundaries stuff, although there was a bit of that, but it was also about Emma&#8217;s whole family history.  Her mother&#8217;s addiction, and her father&#8217;s unwillingness to discuss it, weighs heavily on Emma&#8217;s identity and her friendships and romances are all colored by the voice in the back of Emma&#8217;s head that constantly wonders if she will turn into the woman that has essentially haunted her small family unit all these years.  Her friend Siobhan, who will strike fear and sympathy into the heart of any parent reading this book, was a great catalyst for a lot of the drama.  On one hand, she was the defense against the mean girls at school, but on the other hand, she was as self-destructive as they come and some of her escapades truly made me cringe.  Dylan, who in many ways was the male equivalent of Siobhan, was an interesting romantic interest for both girls.In the end, Afterparty was a book that combined indulgent fun with a story that had a very strong moral compass.  Without being preachy in any way, it showed the snapshot of a journey that contained a lot of conflict, doubt, and ultimately a resolution that balanced entertaining with satisfying.  It was a book that artfully combined a thoughtful story with pure entertainment.\n",

            "This was a gripping book that I couldn't put down (I downloaded the Kindle version during a free promotion and read most of it on my iPad). I found that it was appropriately timed for my life, as its subject is grieving the loss of a family member, and I was reading it after going through a tragedy. In this book a 12-year-old girl dies in a tragic accident. Her mother, father and brother are left to pick up the pieces of their lives and try to move on without her.I definitely had some &#34;issues&#34; with this book, but not enough to stop reading it. Some plot lines were overly contrived, cliche and unrealistic. It switched narrators/points of view from one character to another, which normally irks me to no end, and I can't say I loved it in this book but it actually worked out okay. And the characters were frustrating-- I get that they were supposed to be having trouble communicating but this tension/plot line dragged on and on and on until I was annoyed by it.I thought that the mother was ignoring her son and while I understood her grief about her daughter I didn't think she was being the best mother to her son. At the same time, I thought the dad/husband was being whiny and demanding too much attention from the mom/wife while she was trying to grieve. He seemed selfish and rather like a douchebag to me and I wished she wouldn't have felt so much guilt related to him and instead had felt more guilt related to her son. They were supposed to be this long-term romantic couple but I didn't buy it and it seemed like they barely knew each other. From reading the background on this author, she usually writes romance, so I would think that the husband/wife relationship would be written the best; however, ironically I felt it was the worst relationship in the book. I found it overly complex and then overly trite, but maybe I'm just not the right audience for the &#34;romance&#34; aspect of the book.With all of that being said, I still enjoyed the book and found it to be a good distraction from everyday life, which I needed when I read it. I ended up buying copies of the book for special women in my life for Mother's Day because I think almost any woman would like this book. It never got boring and kept moving on towards a relatively satisfying conclusion. I would like to read more by this author; however, this is her first mainstream fiction book and the rest of her books are romance, which I don't read. (There was a preview of one of her books at the end of this book that seemed interesting and non-romancy, though... even though it's classified as a romance... so maybe I'll check it out, because overall I did like the author's writing style.)\n",

            "Living with GunsCraig R. Whitney spent his entire professional career as a reporter, foreign correspondent, and editor at the `New York Times'. This 284-page book is subtitled \"A Liberal's Case for the Second Amendment\". Whitney retired in 2009 as assistant managing editor in charge of standards and ethics, and lives in New York City. The phrase \"Second Amendment\" often results in an emotional reaction, this book is an attempt to provide a rational discussion (`Introduction'). Americans have an individual constitutional right to own and use guns. Most states say the same and allow carrying handguns in most places. This does not mean they can use them illegally (as the Trayvon Martin shooting). An individual can own and use firearms for self-defense, hunting, or any lawful purpose (p.xii).Should people have to demonstrate a need to carry a handgun? They don't have to do that to exercise the First Amendment (or the Fifth or Sixth, for example). Banning a complete class of guns is unconstitutional (the Heller decision). Should the rules against private gun sales be increased (p.xvi)? Whitney says `yes' but he is wrong. Banning the re-sale of privately owned guns reduces their value to scrap metal and allows their confiscation on the cheap (the Fifth Amendment). Registering firearms leads to confiscation (as in other places), and allows a regressive tax on the owners. The example of that theater shooting in Aurora Colorado is a poor one; I read that the shooter passed his or her background tests. Perhaps people should ask why there are \"mass shootings\" since they appear to have only occurred after WW II. That's about the time politicians began restricting gun ownership and use. That was also the time when Big Corporations destroyed a lot of small businesses (the corner grocery store, etc.). Is there any economic basis for \"mass shootings\"? Is it the result of something in the food or water?The Gun Control Act of 1968 banned the import of firearms, such as any rifle that had a bayonet mount! Armies of the world were discarding their WW I era bolt action rifles to adopt modern arms (like the AK-47). These \"obsolete weapons\" were sold to anyone who would buy them. They said this law would make Americans safer. Then there were about 15,000 violent firearm deaths a year. Over the next 25 years this number escalated to 30,000 violent firearm deaths! You will have to find an old reference book, they may be censored from the Internet. This is a classic example of mis-diagnosing the problem and adopting the wrong solution. Murders are caused by love and money (lust and greed). Suicides are mostly caused by personal reasons. Sweden has the highest suicide rate in Europe. No guns? People jump off high buildings or overdose on medications.This book can't be easily summarized. A \"liberal gun law\" is one with the least restrictions, unlike the conservative or restrictive gun laws of England or Europe. Their laws were enacted because of a fear of a revolution by the people. The 1922 law in England may be a good example. The areas in Chicago with the most crime and murder are also the poorest. If you really want to reduce crime and not oppress people you should ask for an increase in the minimum wage ($10 an hour) and reduce taxes ($20,000 standard deduction for single, $40,000 standard deduction for married). A higher tax bracket of 70% on income over $555,000 would compensate. These numbers are proportionate to the dollar amounts in the prosperous 1950s and 1960s. It could also end the current depression.\n",

            "Thanks to Netgalley for a free copy in exchange for review.I was super excited about this book because it was a chance to follow up with characters from a previous novel called Once Upon a Prince. If you haven&#8217;t read Once Upon a Prince, this book won&#8217;t be remotely worth it, so read that one first.What I really loved about this continuation of the story was the chance to learn about what the characters dealt with after the proposal. That&#8217;s usually where books end. I&#8217;m currently dealing with all of the logistics of planning a wedding and merging two lives, and it&#8217;s not a simple matter. Nate and Susannah had a unique situation, and I love that Rachel dealt with these matters seriously.I read some reviews that thought Susannah was stupid for hesitating on relinquishing her entire life to be with Nate, because &#8216;true love&#8221; will cause you to give up everything without a second thought. I thought that was ridiculous. Susannah had to give up far more than just her family and her roots to take on the duties of a royal of a new nation. I think any woman with any sense would have taken some time to consider the ramifications of what she had to take on.This novella was one of my favorites, and a great mini-sequel to Once Upon a Prince. I&#8217;m thrilled that it worked out for Rachel to include this in the Year of Weddings!\n",

Here, it is argued that if there was a small prior that&#34;terrorists might hijack planes and crash them into buildings,&#34; wewould have had a better chance to connect the dots at the time ofZacaria Moussaoui's arrest prior to 9/11. The chain of reasoning fromthe hypothesis to Moussaoui's arrest is just too long-winded for ahuman to do. A more successful prior might have been that &#34;delusionalpeople want to fly planes&#34;.  I am still not sure that big data and amachine cranking predictions would get it either. After all, humanshave biases but machines have bugs!\n",

            "Very interesting account of life inside the White House through decades of different administrations from the perspective of someone dedicated to the job first, with a non-partisan work ethic. Mr. West describes these ladies as individually as they actually were, bringing them to life so that you see the human side of each lady, regardless of whether or not you agree with their politics. Mr West is careful not to sound gossipy or to sensationalize their lives while living in the White House. The book is tactful and tastefully written. This book is nothing like some other presidential/first family biographies I've read - no eye-popping, scandalous accounts of their daily lives, compared to other biographies. Thanks to Mr. West&#8217;s descriptions, I could almost visualize Eleanor Roosevelt running through the White House, from one meeting to another with tendrils of unkempt hair falling about her shoulders; or recall Jacqueline Kennedy's televised tour of the redecorated White House and hear her odd, whispery voice as she described each room. I found this respectful book quite enjoyable to read. (I just wonder whether Mr. West held on to those yellow legal pads Mrs. Kennedy used to communicate with him. They&#8217;re  probably priceless now!)\n",

            "Sorry, but this story was... (I was thinking, wondering how the reader might react to the comment I was about to leave about a book I struggled to finish so that I could leave an honest opinion about the entire book, and not just the first few chapters. But why would they be angry, knowing that I had read it from cover to cover, and was only expressing what was in my heart? Would they ever read a review I might write about another book? Why must I be so concerned about their reactions?) ... I think I've made my point, but if you didn't catch it, maybe you'll really enjoy this book.One more thing - I couldn't connect with any of the characters in the story. There may have been an abundance of thoughts and feelings flowing, but the only person I \"remotely\" felt for was the little girl, and only due to her unfortunate storyline (her first mommy and daddy). Still, sad to say, didn't feel a heck of a lot after that. Even the pool incident lasted a couple of pages and was quickly over and done with, and wrapped up nice and pretty on \"the wedding day\" when we find out that the 'tearful' neighbor realizes her negligence - excuse me, but if she acts like a bitch throughout the book, why bother to change her character in the last two pages of the book????

            "The fifteenth installment in Laura Childs' thoroughly charming Tea Shop mystery series. I&#8217;ve been reading these stories since the beginning and I was so captivated by her lovely descriptions of Charleston, South Carolina, that I visited that beautifully historic southern city a few years ago&#8230;and I can&#8217;t wait to go back.I recommend reading this series in order, for the progression of Theodosia&#8217;s relationships and residences, and also because some secondary characters that (ahem) may no longer be around.These are lighthearted mysteries featuring Theodosia Browning, an enterprising youngish woman who owns the Indigo Tea Shop in Charleston. Along with her master tea blender, the debonair and classically elegant Drayton Connelly, and Haley, her indomitably creative and efficient chef extraordinaire, they create a little haven of heaven with their delicious offerings and their comforting atmosphere.Of course, Theodosia also stumbles into mystery. In this story, a dead body falls out of a wine barrel at Knighthall Winery&#8217;s wine-tasting party. As always, Theodosia is on hand and, since Drayton&#8217;s friend is the winery&#8217;s owner, she agrees to look into things.The best part of the story, however&#8212;and indeed, the entire series&#8212;is the little details: what the Indigo Tea Shop is serving for lunch, their oh-so-creatively themed tea parties, the colorful and sometimes wacky business owners in Charleston&#8212;including Delaine Dish, the slightly manic owner of a woman&#8217;s clothing store, Cotton Duck&#8212;and the descriptions of the beautiful city of Charleston. In this story, we also get a little education on the winery industry and, because the featured businesses are all small, there&#8217;s some interesting information about running a business in general as well.Theodosia Browning is a beautiful woman and she always seems to have a different boyfriend with each book, but there&#8217;s no serious love interest or love play here, only friendship.As always, Childs includes recipes for food to accompany tea, tea party theme ideas, as well as web sites, tea industry magazines, Charleston tourist information, and even lists of fine tea purveyors and tea plantations.A thoroughly enjoyable mystery and series and a sweet lovely ode to the city of Charleston.\n",

            "What C.J. Sansom does with Dominion - presenting an alternative history in which Winston Churchill does not become Prime Minister of Britain in 1940 and the men who do come to power agree to an appeasement with Germany that finds the now authoritarian government of Britain heavily influenced by their new Fascist friends - is simply fascinating! I love the idea of exploring how every little alteration and change of events can so heavily impact every aspect of our world. And the changes here make for some devastating and far reaching consequences.I have to admit that I got bogged down at times with the various political and social factions discussed and had a hard time keeping them straight (Socialism, Communism, Fascism, Nationalism, Imperialism....just so many &#34;ism's&#34;!). There is so much intricate history here as well - the various countries involved with this ongoing war for German domination, their various leaders and the shifting allegiances between countries, the scientific advancement during this time - that I found myself having to stop reading the book to go look up the many bits and pieces of factual history in order to be able to determine the changes taking places in this alternative world. This slowed down my reading somewhat and caused some confusion but the historical notes at the end of the novel did help alleviate some of that confusion.For me the driving force and what kept bringing be back into the story was the human element. Taking these broad and perplexing ideals and showing how they affected and influenced the people having to live under them made this shifted history seem real and frightening. It was sad yet inspiring to see the many reasons these characters joined Churchill's Resistance and was awe-inspiring to witness the bravery and selflessness they presented. On the flip side it was horrifying to see the greed, prejudice and cruelty of some of the other characters. All of these people came to life for me and thoroughly captured my attention.In particular the two characters that fascinated me the most were Frank Muncaster and Gunther Hoth. Both are such complex, well developed characters that kept surprising me with their growth throughout the story. Frank, the scientist holding a dangerous and deadly secret, is such a sad, scared, introverted character that spent his life being bullied and unloved by everyone but who proved to have more bravery than most could imagine when it mattered. Most surprising of all, I found myself remarkably feeling compassion for Gunther Hoth, a Nazi man through and through, who had lost so much throughout his life but carried on with a purpose and determination to do what he felt was his job and his duty to Germany. He is a monster for what he did and what he supported but one that had a heart, although a twisted and misjudging one in my opinion. I am always delighted to find a novel that makes me feel for characters that are so multidimensional.All in all Dominion is a thought provoking and complex look at how our world and its history can change on a dime based on the wills, egos, and actions of others and how the actions of the few can so alter the lives of the many. This is my first novel by C.J. Sansom but it will definitely not be my last.\n",

            "When I first got a hold of this novel, I thought it was going to be one of those Holy Roller publications. Then when I got into the book, I thought that this novel was heading for the road to perdition. But it's really a mixture of these two predominant religious/ anti religious pathways. In my opinion, Anthony Rhine wrote a credible story balancing the inner happenings of a large Christian Church (not sure what denomination, most likely Protestant), and the mystery of afterlife. This book didn't seem like it would work, but it did in a far-reaching way. The novel held my interest for all of the 346 pages. I'm not sure I can compare this novel with another since the subject matter is so diverse. As a sidebar to the story, the reader is also educated on the differences between Scientology (all eight dynamics), Buddhism, Mormonism, and Hinduism from page 222 through page 241. So what is this story about? Okay, it's time for a synopsis.Our protagonist and narrator is Daniel Bolton. Dan has an unusual trait passed onto him by his mother. He can talk to the dead (mentally) right after they died, normally between four to ten days after passing. The dead are always in a dark transition room waiting to see the light. He has learned bits and pieces of information from them over the years. It seems that the light is called concatenus, which is a place where all spirits go to be linked together and share the intelligence with the whole (God?). Some of the dead get reincarnated instead of going back into the light. Dan is not sure about the people who are going to hell since he has never talked to one. On page 84, Dan states, \"You see, enough chats with spirits in transition have given me small glimpses into what awaits us beyond this earthly world, and I have been able to piece those glimpses together to get a sense of where we are going.\"After High School, Dan gets a job with the Elizabeth Community Church as an actor in a play being performed at the church. The Pastor, Greg Woolfe, is a vile bigoted man married to Violet Black, a cold offensive assistant to the pastor (these are the road to perdition people). Somehow Dan prospers at the church and keeps moving up the ladder until he is on equal footing with Violet. Greg sends both of them to the seminary for gratis with the stipulation that they have to stay with the church until he retires. Greg and Violet have many poisonous foul mouthed arguments throughout the novel. Then Dan has a one-night stand with Violet (very bad move). Subsequently, Dan falls in love with a teenage actress, Melissa, acting in one of their plays at the church. He now has the obnoxious Violet Black as a enemy for life. The affair with Melissa is also going to cause grief for Dan in the future.What I liked about the novel was the way the author switched back and forth from the church activities to Dan's talks with the dead. Most notable was Dan's discussion with a dead man named Chen. Apparently, they were speaking Mandarin. They had a long talk while Chen was in the dark transition room. On page 246, Chen says, \"I can tell you this: I was right  to live a good life. I was right to believe that I would one day be where I am now and I was right that I  would eventually go back to where I am to go back to.\" \"Concatenus?\" I (Dan) wanted to say it again, seeking further confirmation. \"Daniel, that is only a word\" (answers Chen). This is some good stuff. So what I am wondering is this: Does the author believe in the afterlife that he describes in this titillating story? Well, maybe he will post a comment on this review and  reveal his thoughts. Listen, I only gave you tidbits of what this novel is about, there is much more woe ahead for our hero Dan in the ensuing pages. I highly recommend this enlightening novel, so go out and buy your own copy.\n",

            "Another excellent Oliver Sacks book built on case studies, with a review of the history of the phenomenon (even back to antiquity), salted with personal experiences and accounts of youthful indiscretions.  Many of the cases are weird or lurid, so the book is quite entertaining.  The presentation is sufficiently scholarly that the cases will be useful paradigms for others investigating epistomology or religiosity, though Sacks touches only lightly on these issues.  There is a good index and an excellent bibliography.The cases chosen are mostly not people who are &#34;crazy,&#34; and part of the point must be that the range of normal human ability and experience is much wider than most of us believed.  I hope this is consoling to practitioners in mental health; I note that some other readers were offended to read that not only saints have visions and, yes, doctors often abuse drugs.As far as science goes, there isn't much.  Sacks observes that poking specific parts of the brain can produce certain effects fairly consistently, and he offers some conjectures and hypotheses as to why, but the bottom line is that we really don't know.  This is how science begins, collecting and sorting observations, and poking things to see if something will happen.  I think Sacks' books provide a valuable service in disseminating expertly documented case studies which others can build upon to devise better experiments and theories.They are good reads.\n",

The beginning took a bit to get off the ground, but I liked the characters and I liked the different take on the vampire world. In this novel only men can be vampires, but they feed their blood to women making them stronger thus training them to become their &#34;watchers&#34;. All of these young woman have been cast from general society for one reason or another so this stop on Isle of Night is literally their last stop. Many of them will die during the training that lasts several years before they are made a watcher.I'll admit there are lots of unrealistic moments, but isn't that always true with any paranormal read. The apparent ease with which the vampires are able to get all of these girls onto the island is a bit of a stretch as well as how quickly the girls accept their new roles and that vampires really do exist. You would think a hundred girls witnessing a vampire attack would all run off screaming, but no, they just follow said vampires to their dorms where they accept their new fate and proceed to attend classes and training to learn their new roles.

Then I googled Boonsboro and discovered that the inn in question exists in \"real life\" and is owned by the author, as is the bookshop.  This use of a novel to promote a business venture would be fine if the story were interesting.  It's not.  The romance is only a side story -- the real story is about all the details relating to the refurbishment of the Inn, and the plans to buy stuff to put in it.  The heroine is perfectly acceptable but seems untouched by her past, the Hero is unbelievably perfect, and there is absolutely no tension in the relationship at all.  No angst, no obstacles in the way, nothing.  At the end I felt as if I'd been manipulated into reading a long ad for the inn.  I won't be reading the others in the series.\n",

While Chapman doesn't sprinkle it with as many of his real life anecdotes as in the 5LL, he does manage enough practical applications to keep the individual attentive.  The writing is more clinical than personal, but for a book like this, it should be.  The book provides tests/work sheets for assessing personal and co-worker appreciation languages and suggests methodologies for implementing them in your workplace.

What he finds as passionate such as betrayal and danger could cost him his life. Dax the hot pool boy is apparently straight and this beautiful guy comes with a lot of baggage and I mean a lot! These guys have to soon realize that taking a risk can be so rewarding; spiritually and emotionally!Damien and Dax characters were so well written that I so enjoyed reading them! The author's details about these men is so hot and steamy, I was panting through each page and wanting more and more. Damien's ex-boyfriend, Aaron is not the nicest guy and comes back into his life to create some major havoc. Will Damien find true love? Will Aaron cause too much damage?How this brilliant author writes about the incredibly hot sex scenes was well written and yet there was a great story to accompany the steamy scenes.

I'm a Happily Ever After kind of girl and I had to know if it was worth my time to read the previous pages.  If you are anything like that, DO NOT SKIP TO THE END.  Just trust me on this.

It is, at its' essence, Ty & Zane living real life and realizing that the real life they have, while good, could be better.  It is them shouldering through the ups and downs of figuring things out amid the real pressures of real life in a real relationship.  It is them coming to terms with actually finding themselves wanting just what everyone else has, with all the crap that comes with it.

It was interesting to learn about some of the medical practices, including ones being discontinued such as using leeches to bleed someone.  I liked most of the characters but Elizabeth's roommate, Gwen, got on my nerves for a very poor choice she made and for her attitude.  I wished the story had a bit more action in the middle but it made up for it in the end!  This can easily be read as a stand-alone, but characters from previous books are present and mentioned.  I liked the sweet romance and the struggle the main characters had over what their futures should look like, from Elizabeth wanting to remain a doctor but wondering about marriage and motherhood to Jason's ideas of what a mother should be.

Ms. Lederman writes her so well. Edna was me as a teenager, the girl I want to go back and smack from here to next Sunday.

Landon and Grace both made some really bad mistakes and especially Grace who was sent into a deathly downward spiral with her bad choices.There was an HEA of sorts anyway after much turmoil, and this book was such an emotionally draining experience, I was happy to see a light at the end of so much darkness and despair.This is not like any other MC book you have read before...more of a relationship study that just happens to be among some ex-military bikers and the woman they love.**** 4 **** &#34;love, honor and devotion&#34; stars\n",

The book carries on following the lives of two gay lovers Zach and Ryan and their decision to go on a romantic weekend that brings changes in their lives that they'd never anticipated. Unlike similar books in the genre that I've read, Drunk In Love manages to play with your emotions and still leave you desperate for more, a characteristic which I think is becoming a hallmark of the More Than Friends series. What I like most of all is how the author Aria Grace has expertly managed to balance the gripping underlying plot of the story with scenes of steamy erotica without making the plot confusing or erratic. Overall I think that if you're looking for an enjoyable piece of erotic fiction that's easy to dip in and out of, Drunk in Love certainly won't disappoint!\n",

The main character, I think her name was Almose, was but a 12 year old when the story begins. But, she does gain a few years throughout the story. I read the whole book, I wanted to know what was going to happen, but when I finished the book, I felt 'incomplete'. Maybe that's not the right word, but anyway, I pondered the book and it's writing. The writer was a good writer, but for me, there was such a strange character development. Some of her characters I just did not understand. One minute you think you have their character figured out, and on the next page the character acts so 'out of character' you wonder, 'what the heck? That's not what that character would be doing!'

She was independent and strong. Linde does not disappoint. Liz, is sarcastic, quick, intelligent, and holds her own- which is hard to do because Brady is a force. There are a lot of situations in this book that would have any female lead, whiny and bitchy, Liz is none of those. WITHOUT being a pushover. She speaks her mind. Love her. To be honest, every single character was strong and intriguing. I was automatically sucked in by them, captivated. I had put in the release party that it was not the forbidden romance, but to me the need to get more of these characters and the chemistry.2. Linde is intelligent. Not saying that other authors are not, but political wise. I love politics, I have read a few other authors. I find that A. They either no nothing about it and avoid any topics of government, B. No nothing and straight wikipedia it, C. No everything and decide it is best to put everything into one book. Not all of the readers are political. I think Linde did PoliSci? yes, no? But either way, she streamed in political topics that were enough to keep the political minds intrigued and not bore the non political minds.3. The ending was not a cliffhanger but a .... without giving too much, we were able to see another side to someone and understand some of their inner struggle, and we were able to see a powerful move. well played. I will be waiting for the next book, but I will not be anxiously waiting. The book, ultimately, could have ended at this one and I think that is a plus.Overall, I loved it. It was sexy, and smart. Kudos Linde.\n",

            "Patenaude's book is primarily about Trotsky's years in Mexico, from January 1937 until his assassination in August of 1940 (his \"flashbacks\" to earlier events are not as well researched, and contain a number of errors). That's the only reason I read it, since Mexico is the weakest part of the definitive Isaac Deutscher trilogy,The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921,The Prophet Unarmed: Trotsky 1921-1929and theThe Prophet Outcast: Trotsky 1929-1940, being given only one chapter in the last of these, a book that covers Trotsky's life from 1929-40.The author's thesis is that Trotsky was in decline, creating unnecessary battles with his followers. No one ever said that Trotsky was easy to get along with, but anyone with an understanding of Marxism knows that clarification takes place amidst the clash of ideas. Patenaude makes a big deal about what wasn't important, like the disagreements in the Socialist Workers Party in Trotsky accepting to invitation to testify before the Dies Committee (which became the House Committee on Un-American Activities. There were always some in the party at that time who wanted to present themselves as more \"revolutionary\" than Trotsky. Had Trotsky testified, it would have given him an opportunity to speak more directly to the American working class, and he would not have said anything different than what he said anywhere else. But apparently Dies understood this, and probably only invited him thinking he would refuse. When he accepted, Dies rapidly cancelled the invitation, giving Trotsky the moral high ground.The split with the Shachtman group was a big deal, but Patenaude totally fails to understand what it was about. He blames Trotsky for precipitating  the split, which he views as totally unnecessary. He quotes a member of the Shachtman group as saying \"The war broke out and we did nothing.\" While the debate covered many important questions fundamental to Marxism, it was, above all, a debate about what position to take in World War II, the majority defending the point of view that Trotsky had always held, that of defense of the Soviet Union against imperialism, despite the Stalinist degeneration.This struggle took almost half the membership, but it left the party in a stronger position to fight against the war, and the persecution of the party under the Smith Act (seeTeamster Bureaucracy,Socialism on Trial) andThe Socialist Workers Party in World War II: Writings and Speeches, 1940-43 (James P. Cannon writings & speeches)) precisely for representing an important antiwar current within the labor movement.To fully understand the split with the Shachtmanites, one must read and understandIn Defense of Marxism: The Social and Political Contradictions of the Soviet UnionandThe Struggle for a Proletarian Party.The best part of the book is the use of important material from the archives of Joseph Hansen, secretary to Trotsky in Mexico, and life-long leader of the Socialist Workers Party. I also suggest reading the Pathfinder edition ofMy Life: An Attempt at an Autobiography, which has an introduction by Hansen entitled \"With Trotsky in Coyoac&aacute;n.\"\n",

            "My CommentsSome of my blogging friends have been reading this book so I noticed it recently and fell head over heels in love with both the cover and title, I immediately put it on my TBR (to be read/gotta have) list!  Then I got the chance to review it and it felt like a Christmas present had dropped into my lap, grateful doesn&#8217;t begin to explain how that felt.Welcome to Gudrid&#8217;s world, a Viking woman with heart and skills beyond the women of her culture.  The book starts off describing a pagan sacrifice that breaks Gudrid&#8217;s heart, but also begins her journey of faith in Christ.  If the god Thor requires such sacrifices, then Gudrid wants no part in obeying him.Even though I sooooo enjoyed the story, the writing really gets your attention from the start, I didn&#8217;t connect with Gudrid at first.  There&#8217;s just this sadness that stays with her even though she has done well for herself.  There&#8217;s only one character who is surprised by how many times Gudrid has been married, no one else finds this alarming so even though I agreed with that one comment I figured this was a common occurrence for this time period.  &#8220;You&#8217;ve been married how many times?&#8221;  From his intense look, I know he&#8217;s not being disrespectful with his question.&#8221;My favorite character in this story is the unnamed female wolf.  It&#8217;s amazing how Gudrid finds her and rescues her.  Even though wolves are predators, this one was easy to love as it protected Gudrid, her animals, and even her people.One of my favorite parts of the story is when Gudrid adopts two boys who come from enemy lines.  I was in amazement over that and this enhances the storyline tremendously!My favorite thing about Gudrid is her faith.  She puts herself and her desires last to care for and lead her people and her son.  This book is FULL of people making sacrifices and risking their lives for their clan, but Gudrid&#8217;s heart and discernment takes that to a new level.  She understands so much from observing, it takes a lot for her to trust others but when you have her loyalty you have it for life, and she&#8217;s all about keeping the peace but when her son&#8217;s life is in danger she&#8217;s willing to kill to protect him.  In the midst of all she&#8217;s undertaking, she still follows Christ with all her heart and even tells her people about Him without preaching.  Her greatest desire is to be an example of God to her people when so many pagan gods are respected.I felt confused about who Leif was for the first part of the book, but that was my misunderstanding and not any fault with the writing.  I believed he had been one of her husbands that died and he&#8217;s Gudrid&#8217;s brother-in-law who is married to another woman.  Gudrid isn&#8217;t liked by most of the women from her home in Greenland, but she easily befriends her female slaves and does what she can to protect them from unwanted attention.There is much violence in the story, but it&#8217;s realistic to the time period.  Gudrid is willing to kill only when necessary.  Her people carry knives, spears, swords, and axes to protect themselves against enemy invaders.  Gudrid is unhappy and uncomfortable for most of the story until they leave the island.  The character I liked least was her sister-in-law, Freydis.  At first I was really intrigued by this character and her off color warrior, tree climbing ways, but Freydis does too many foolish things and is reckless for my taste.  She gets into enough trouble and creates enough conflict for the story to go forward, but she&#8217;s not someone I felt attached to or had respect for.  However, her craziness only illustrates Gudrid&#8217;s strength further as she fights to help her sister.  Freydis is a die hard loyal person to her family, but I also considered her a danger to herself and those around her.In an age when women had so few choices, survival was more important than comfort, and being a pagan believer was more common than faith in Christ, it&#8217;s absolutely amazing watching Gudrid cope with doing what&#8217;s right over what&#8217;s desired.  Marriage is more about business and survival than emotions, housekeeping skills with the women are vital among clans, and staying healthy in a constantly changing climate is crucial.  Gudrid doesn&#8217;t have vitamins to work with, but she knows her way around herbs and her faith has taught her that prayer and speaking words of life will help more than carrying a sword even though she does that too.  Being a Viking woman with faith in Christ is an unconventional way to live, but Gudrid makes it work despite the sadness she endures.I thought this book would be the Braveheart version for women (not so much), but there is plenty of action and I truly enjoyed seeing the Viking world through Gudrid&#8217;s eyes despite all the hardships she goes through.  There was one relationship I wanted to understand better and that was Gudrid&#8217;s marriage to Finn.  There are many misunderstandings between them, but everything does get resolved and I was overjoyed that they grow closer to one another.  Gilbert&#8217;s debut book is a definite treat and I&#8217;m so grateful for the chance to review it!  I couldn&#8217;t wait to see how the story progressed and went through this one FAST!  The book takes an honest look at life in the 10th century and brings the reader hope and action in authentic ways.  I&#8217;m grateful for characters like Gudrid (all she is able to overcome) and for writers like Gilbert who bring these stories to life.I want to thank the author for the review copy provided, truly thanks!!  I was not required to write a positive review.  The opinions expressed are my own.\n",

            "This action-packed series ender explores authority, loyalty, sacrifice, and the fear of the unknown. It begins where &#8220;A Million Suns&#8221; left off, as a group of colonists are ready to leave their spaceship and land on planet Centauri-Earth after departing Earth five hundred years ago. It&#8217;s an original mixture of science fiction, mystery, and romance, set in a dystopian world.The first two novels introduced readers to Amy and Elder, who have formed a strong connection in adversity. The short chapters are told in their alternating first-person narration. The benefit is that this serves to move the action along at a quick pace. However, their voices are virtually indistinguishable, so while reading I had to be sure to make note of who was narrating each chapter.The trilogy is strong on the setup, suspense, revelations, and plot twists. The sci-fi scenario is skillfully brought to life, as the characters step onto an alien planet for the first time and the body count grows. The middle section moves a bit slowly, but the last one hundred pages of &#8220;Shades of Earth&#8221; are tense and fast-paced. I found the ending satisfying.\n",

            "This is marketed as a vampire book, and I do have to say that I felt that there was not as much about vampires as I expected. I would, in fact, categorize it as a \"Hell comes to earth\" book. Vampires are not the only baddie that shows up to plague our intrepid hero and his unit- they're not even the worst.Overall, I did actually enjoy this book quite a bit. This book reminded me (a bit) of the movie PRIEST.However, there were some serious flaws. The author uses just a select few adjectives to describe the same things over and over. If I had to read that something was ebon (black) one more time, I was going to scream. Also, things get described over and over, as though the author thinks his readers are too stupid to remember what he has already told them.Not all of the flashbacks are as clearly defined as they should be, although I never found them confusing enough to actually get lost.The sister's story is also not as developed as it should have been.In the end, I felt that this book deserved 3 1/2 stars.

            "Like most schools boys, I had heard of the Greek triumph over the Persians, focused mainly on Thermopylae and the 300 Spartans that died there saving the Greeks. And, oh yes, there was a naval battle. In the Battle of Salamis, Barry Strauss completes the story with an exciting story of them men and women and boats and weapons with which the Greeks and Persians went after them.What drew me into the book was the detail with which Strauss gives us in describing the ships and the men who sailed them. I found myself looking up pictures of a trireme so I could envision what these navies looked like.  Strauss details how the three decks of rowers were tied to their seats, how the marines stayed seated when they launched their spears or let loose their arrows. And he gives us brutal detail on how the boats rammed and speared each other in the narrow straits off Salamis.But ultimately it was the force of two men, Xerxes and Themistocles, who led their respective forces that determined the outcome of the historic battle between Greece and Persia. Strauss gives each his due, and fairly illustrates their strengths and weaknesses. A good sailor's tale well tols.\n",

            "We know carbs are bad for us, especially white, refined carbs, but did you know that carbs can slowly destroy your brain? That&#8217;s the argument that David Perlmutter makes in his book //Grain Brain//.Perlmutter, a neurologist as well as board certified nutritionist, and founder of the American Board of Integrative and Holistic Medicine, is in a unique position to see how nutrition affects our neurology and his findings are astounding. He charges carbohydrates, especially glutens, with contributing to, if not downright causing, all types of prevalent and preventable diseases, such as dementia, ADHD, diabetes, libido, migraine headaches, depression, inflammation, obesity, and more. He proposes that humans have evolved to eat a high fat, low carb diet, but stresses that they must be the right kinds of fats, and in correct proportion. For instance, omega 3s and omega 6s should be in balance, in a 1:1 ratio. This diet, more similar to the Mediterranean diet than the low-carb Atkins diet, stresses meats, nuts, vegetables, and some fruits, as well as salad dressings and dipping sauces. It actually looks pretty tasty, even from a carb-lover&#8217;s point of view.With so many food books and opinions and diets out there, it&#8217;s difficult to know who to listen to. Perlmutter seems to have a valid opinion (no juice fasts or grapefruit diets here) and advocates veggies and meats, so you really can&#8217;t go wrong with that. But if you suffer from a chronic disease, have an interest in staving off brain disease, or even just want add more grist to the mill on the topic of food, diet, and nutrition, this might be a good read for you. If nothing else, it&#8217;ll help make you more aware of what you&#8217;re sticking in your mouth and we all can stand to be a little more aware of that.--Review also provided to portlandbookreview.com\n",

            "There are six short stories in this novel.  Six different authors that bring lust and erotica to the pages.  I like to read something short and sweet and sexy after something intense or dark just to pull me out of my funk......the book hangover as it were.  These stories did that.  There is nothing heavy in the BDSM and it was fun. All six stories are individual, different and unconnected other than the mild BDSM.  All six are very well written.  Erotic, sexy and really hot as well.The Exhibition by: London Saint James: is about a woman and her best friend (gay male) attending his Brother's art show.  The trio has known each other for a very long time but, the older brother has skated around his attraction for her just as she has for him believing it would offend or upset the younger brother.  Then as with most misguided beliefs she tears away because she's afraid of being dumped....so she dumps him first...  That's when the fun begins.Amazing Maisie by: Raven McAllan:  A woman who would like to explore the BDSM world and is attracted to a DOM.  Fortunately her friend is his sister and they find themselves working toward a relationship that he coaxes her to even though she has nightmares about the possible things he expects (And doesn't actually want at all).  He is gentle and explains his intentions relieving her fears.  It is a loveable story.Liberating Lua by: Elyzabeth M. VaLey:  A Lord of the BDSM type is married to a genuine Lady and is afraid to invite her into his dark world.  So he uses a handmaiden to release his desires although, good husband that he is, never has sex with her.  The Lady has been taught from early childhood that a good Lady allows her husband the lust without her response.  But, she feels and is afraid to tell him.  Then she finds out about he handmaiden and demands to take her place....Wow.  This is definitely erotic in story and nature.Taboo by: Doris O'Connor:  &#34;Uncle&#34; Joshua has been infatuated to the point of distraction over the daughter of his best friend he has watched grow up.  She's twenty five now and his thoughts are no longer tame.  But, he's heavy into the BDSM life and she's pure and innocent......so he thought.  He discovers her being abused by a baby Dom and rescues her.  Come to find out our young Lucy isn't so innocent and has had the hots for Joshua for way too many years.  She's old enough to act on them now and she lets him know it in no uncertain terms.  It gets hotter, sexier and way more dangerous as her Father gets closer to finding out the truth about both of them.Lock Stock and Spank Her:  By R. Brennan:  I actually found this one to be the most &#34;fun&#34; of them all.  Beth is new to the world and her training Mistress is taking her to her first &#34;munch&#34;.  I had never heard that term before but, began to draw that it is a gathering and demonstration to introduce product and people....do not go on that as reality, strictly theory.  Beth is nervous.  Her Mistress finds out who her mystery &#34;friend&#34; is and she builds the nerve to talk to him.  He is the creator and demonstrator of the equipment being shown.  He asks her to volunteer and the feelings and emotions build for both of them.  This is a lighthearted and fun story.  I would love to see how a full version of this story would be told.The Cowboy and the Schoolmarm: by Nikki Prince:  This is a modern day western.  Fun, playful and one overbearing Dom of a cowboy (Would we really want for less?) Melanie is in love with Shiloh as young adults but, he goes off without ever telling her he'll return.  So she agrees to marry his friend.  He returns to late but, the husband dies and now she's a widow.  NOW, it's his turn to sway her back.  He goes after her full throttle.  She doesn't want to struggle but, she's torn with pride.  He has to push through it.  Hello, he's a cowboy Dom, is there any other questions?I enjoyed this Anthology very much.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes shorts or needs something light between the really heavy stuff that can leave you wrung out.  Definitely a pick me upper.  Very hot, a four fan set of stories.\n",

Torin has owned my heart, but Echo has shown that he is just as special in my eyes.Cora has just been released from a mental institution and wants nothing more than for her life to go back to normal. But how can you have normal when you are regularly followed by souls and your world has been inhabited by Grimnirs, Immortals, Gods, Norns and Valkyries, and there appears to be mystery and danger at every turn. And then there's the gorgeous, infuriating soul reaper who makes your blood boil one minute and has your heart doing flips the next.I like my books to be heavy on the romance and Ednah Walter's has delivered just what I need once again. I thought Cora's heart belonged to Eirik and I was so torn when Echo emerged on the scene. But Echo won me over. He is a man who truly believes that he's not worthy of love. He believes that his heart and soul are bad. Yes, he's done bad things but he's had such horrid pain in his life. Thank God Cora saw right through him and saw the beautiful, loving man that was buried under his cockiness. He protects, he cares, and he loves. Boy, does he love!!There was lots of mystery and action to offset the hot romance and I found myself questioning almost everyone's motives at some point during the book. I really felt that I was taking this great journey of discovery right alongside Cora as she learnt more about her new world and it's inhabitants and her abilities.I'm so happy that the author is writing these books to give us greater insights into the other characters. After reading this I liked Cora so much more. She has much more substance than what I originally thought. And as much as I want to get to know all the characters better, my greedy self is also jumping up and down because it means that the Runes series still has a fair way to go before it wraps up.Theres not one particular thing that makes Ednah Walters Runes series a standout to me. It's a whole combination of things. It's the fantastic, easy to read writing style. It's the world building and plot twists. It's the incredibly likeable characters. Its the gorgeous swoony males. It's the fine line between Young Adult and New Adult that she manages to walk the story along. This series just keeps getting better with each book.5/5 Cocky and Passionate Echo StarsThis book was gifted to me for an honest review.FAVOURITE QUOTES: I shook my head. I'd never met a man with a one-track mind. &#34;Just when I'm beginning to see something redeemable in you, you open your mouth and spoil it.&#34;***I wanted someone to kiss me like he couldn't get enough of me. Touch me like he'd die if we didn't. Look at me like he was seeing me for the first time every time we were together. I wanted Echo.***His chest was right there, begging me to kiss it, so I did, and he groaned. Best fantasy ever.\n",

            "The short version of why Hellboy&#8217;s in hell is that at the end of the last Hellboy book, The Storm and The Fury, he slew the dragon and saved England but died when he was caught off guard and the ghost of the witch Nimue plucked out his heart. This is what happened next&#8230;Hellboy in Hell isn&#8217;t just the title of the book but a pretty accurate summary of what happens in the book. There isn&#8217;t a plot, it&#8217;s just Hellboy wandering around hell looking at stuff with a variety of different Virgils explaining what he&#8217;s looking at. This is weirdly the book&#8217;s strength and weakness because this is the first Hellboy book Mike Mignola&#8217;s both written and drawn in years, and his art has only improved with age. So while Hellboy meanders, the creatures and backgrounds he comes across are visually incredible.Here hell isn&#8217;t the fire and brimstone Christian stereotype but in Mignola&#8217;s hands becomes an ethereal, perpetually twilit land of eerie shadows against Victorian buildings. The effect is quietly chilling as wonderfully ancient structures give an old world atmosphere and provides a gorgeous backdrop to the flying demons and Lovecraftian monsters that float around. Pandemonium sits in the midst of the muted yet ominous Lake of Fire, a looming collection of ancient Roman-esque architectural buildings surrounded by creepy talking statues housing the seat of hell&#8217;s power, the Citadel of the Fly, and the Devil himself. If nothing else, Hellboy in Hell is worth picking up for Mignola&#8217;s first-rate art.But when it comes to story, things get a bit messy. Ideas like Hellboy going to the place where he&#8217;s been banishing monsters for decades, like a cop sent to prison and meeting all the criminals he&#8217;s put away, is touched on for a spell before being shuffled away and forgotten. Literary allusions pepper the script from Dickens&#8217; A Christmas Carol being parodied, to lines from Shakespeare and Milton being quoted, all of which give the impression of a deep, complex read when it really isn&#8217;t. Hellboy doesn&#8217;t want the throne of hell so Mignola throws in a line or two from Macbeth which says something similar &#8211; kinda obvious.The more successful elements of the narrative are things that have been explored in previous Hellboy books &#8211; Hellboy&#8217;s purpose for existing and his right hand of doom, which mark him out to be the heir to the throne of hell. Mignola re-treads some of this material but adds more detail behind Hellboy&#8217;s birth mother and introduces his demonic half-brothers who want Hellboy&#8217;s power even if he doesn&#8217;t. What happens when Hellboy encounters Satan himself is the most interesting part of the book as it makes the reader wonder what happens to hell afterwards but Mignola doesn&#8217;t take that thread any further (maybe to explore in later issues?).I appreciate Mignola&#8217;s ambitious vision where he&#8217;s literally creating his own idea of hell utilising numerous artistic sources throughout human history while making it distinctly his, and Hellboy&#8217;s, own, but I kept waiting for Hellboy to try to figure out a way to come back to Earth. He seemed more than happy to simply be just in hell &#8211; is this it? Is Hellboy going to be in hell, walking about while remaining nonplussed, forever? The final story in the book is a standalone piece where Hellboy&#8217;s having a smoke when a lost spirit asks him for help and they go on a little adventure. It seems indicative of Mignola&#8217;s approach to Hellboy&#8217;s new situation &#8211; that he&#8217;s content to keep Hellboy in hell for the time being and be in no particular hurry to return him to Earth, or point him in any narrative direction at all.The Descent isn&#8217;t the best Hellboy book if you&#8217;re looking for a more driven narrative but it&#8217;s fine for what it does which is establish and explore the fascinating new setting for Hellboy &#8211; though I&#8217;m assuming this is done because Hellboy&#8217;s staying in hell for a while; if not, then this is a lot of pretty filler. I would like to feel that there was a point to all of this but the ambling way Mignola writes these days shows that urgency isn&#8217;t something he&#8217;s overly concerned with and that he prefers to show interesting things rather than tell interesting stories &#8211; a quality that doesn&#8217;t make for amazing comics.The art really is gorgeous though and it isn&#8217;t hard to see why the book looks amazing when the art team is Mignola, Dave Stewart on colours and Clem Robins lettering, and parts of the book are entertaining to read but the overall impression of Hellboy in Hell Vol 1 is of a fragmentary and unsatisfactory story. Which is a shame because after Batman and Superman, Hellboy&#8217;s my favourite superhero and I really wanted Hellboy in Hell to be the masterpiece I hoped it would be but it turned out to be an underwhelming next chapter in the Hellboy saga.\n",

It's extraordinarily smart and well-written and is filled with complex, flesh and blood characters I'll consider for a long time.One of the novel's most impressive achievements is the Tartt weaves the symbolism, compositional elements, and even biographical context of Fabritius's Goldfinch into the plot of this modern bildungsroman.All of that said, there are portions of this book which ALMOST jump the shark. It's probably about 100 pages longer than it needs to be, and the ending, though comprised of some of the book's most poetic writing, feels exhaustively verbose and incredibly awkward in its metafictional posture. These moments aren't enough to knock even one star off the constellation of this novel, but it is worth noting that Tartt has room to improve, which is scary.This is a no-brainer purchase. If you care about modern American fiction, art, and the ways we find to deal with suffering, this book is perfect.\n",

            "The Guardian DukeBy: Jamie Carie5 starsReviewed by:AngelsFormat:Kindle/HardcoverPublished: B&amp;H BooksSource: Purchased Copy Gene:Christian RomanceBook Blurb/Synopsis-The Guardian Duke is award-winning novelist Jamie Carie&#8217;s most exciting story yet, a uniquely arranged Regency-era romantic adventure where hero and heroine know each other through written letters but have yet to meet.Gabriel, the Duke of St. Easton, is ordered by the King to take guardianship over Lady Alexandria Featherstone whose parents are presumed dead after failing to return from a high profile treasure hunt. But Alexandria ignores this royal reassignment, believing her parents are still alive and duly following clues that may lead to their whereabouts. Gabriel, pressured by what are actually the King&#8217;s ulterior motives, pursues her across windswept England and the rolling green hills of Ireland but is always one step behind.When they do meet, the search for earthly treasure will pale in comparison to what God has planned for both of them.Our ReviewWhat a great start to a series. I found the characters to be engaging funny , serious and some to be our white Knight !Alexandria becomes the guardian of the Duke of St. Easton when Alexandria's parents are presumed dead.Her parents are treasure hunting looking for a lost tomb that has gone missing from a collection. Alexandria does not believe her parents are dead so puts forth a plan to rescue them but, to do that she needs money to travel with. Alex corresponds with the Duke making up or stretching the truth about the amount of money she needs to keep things running at home. Alex letters are so funny they have you cracking up. She is talking to the Duke not knowing what to say to him, saying things no lady would say, speaking her mind in those letters a crossing certain parts out but ,sending the letter as is.Hilarious !The purpose of the letters is really to distract the Duke from making her leave her home a coming to him but, in doing so she is building a relationship with her Duke. Alex sets forth on looking for her parents and finds a champion to help her in her travels. The Duke learning she has gone from her home sets out to travel after her and bring her back to safely.These two play at Cat and mouse game the whole story through.Alex lets the Duke know her where abouts just enough to keep him interested but, always several steps ahead and out of reach as she is not going back to England she is finding her parents even if it kills her !I loved this story it was a very fun read and quite the page turner. I never laughed so hard reading the parts where Alex is writing her letters to the Duke.The Duke feels he has gotten to know who Alex is through her letters and learns that she is one of a kind.He is falling in love.This little adventure was packed with enough intrigue to keep you on the edge always wondering what will happen next. There adventure led them to developing a  long and lasting relationship.Alex might be developing a love interest which will complicate things for the Duke.The story right up to the end was delightful leaving a cliff hanger on what happens next ! This book is a keeper for me just one of the heart felt romances that is developing little by little without either party realizing the extent of there feeling just yet!Recommended read to all !\n",

This was recommended by a friend who promised this was unlike anything else I'd ever read and to step out of my boring comfort zone.It definitely was not and I will stick to my comfort zone next recommendation.I do not like writing negative reviews. It is very, very rare for me to not finish a book and this was coming close to being the first book in four years that I did not finish.I think what kind of bothered me is that it seems like a ripoff of one of my favorite TV shows. I wondered more than once if the author is a fan of the show and if so, if she was inspired by it and this is her way of honoring said show.I disliked all of the characters. Every single one of them. Well, okay. Layla had some redeeming qualities and was the only one that I didn't want to run over with my fictional truck. Repeatedly.Not only is this a very slow read to the point that I wanted to rip my hair out, but could have used another go around with an editor as I found many misspelled words, incorrect grammar, and plenty of punctuation errors.Definitely a read for an adult who doesn't mind gratuitous language and graphic sex scenes {Note: I am over 21 and did read the warning and went by my friend's standard that it wasn't &#34;that bad&#34;. Apparently we don't have the same standards}I do have to say that even though I didn't care for it and won't be continuing on to read the second book, I think every book should not be judged by its reviews, but read with an open mind, hence why I read it.\n",

Their banter was entertaining and it just felt like it could really happen!As the story progresses, though, I felt like many parts were rushed (including many of the &#34;erotic&#34; scenes). I didn't really empathize with either character. I understood that she had a rough life (although this wasn't really developed until late in the book), and he's a &#34;control&#34; freak - but I didn't FEEL this by reading the story.Which made it unbelievably difficult to believe the D/s angle...He never explained what he expects from a &#34;subbie&#34;, and she just blankly followed his lead. I think I was expecting a bit more substance from this part of the book, in particular.Overall, it was a quick story full of romance (general & erotic).\n",

            "Having this book toted as a YA series on Amazon and shelved in the Teen section at book stores is very deceiving.  My daughter and I both enjoyed the first book and we both looked forward to reading this second book, Endless Knights, as well. I borrowed this book from my daughter before she had a chance to read it and I'm glad I did.  Not because it is a great story, but because of the sex within.Maybe my opinions do not sit with the majority but I don't believe my teen needs to be fed such descriptions of a sexual act that was depicted in this book.  Instead of quoting the author's story and chancing a child reading this review, I would suggest you go to a book store and read page 115 before purchasing for your child if this type of thing is uncomfortable for them.  I stopped reading after page 157, as it just began to seem like a good story idea that was lost due to the unnecessary graphic nature.  In reading some reviews before I wrote this, I find that there are additional sex scenes with the main character and a different man.  I strongly feel that if publishers want to push books into the YA category, there should be a similar rating on them as movies and video games.  Why can't the publisher give the young adult consumer the heads up about explicit sexual content?  I don't feel that a young reader should be left to innocently stumble upon something so uncomfortable for them.\n",

            "Cat has been pressing her husband of ten years for a foursome with their new next door neighbors.What started out as some smoking hot sex between four consenting adults went completely wrong. From the start you could see this was a train wreck just waiting to happen. In getting to know the characters a bit better, I took a dislike to Cat. She seemed like she was always up to no good. She came across as very fake. Her husband Drew seemed to just put it with her and whatever diabolical plan she was cooking up.Logan and his wife Alexis didn't have a great relationship either. Logan was always pointing out her faults and finding her lacking in just about everything. Alexis was the most reserved of all four of them. At times it looked as though she was participating in this kink only to please her husband.When all four of them get together in any kind of interaction it's apparent that Drew and Alexis would be the better match of the couples.Even knowing this was something horrible that would blow up in their faces, I couldn't put it down. With knowing it was bound to end badly, I still had to see it for myself.\n",

That made me nervous. Popular books and I tend to not mix for some reason. I should not have fretted because All Lined Up was amazing and nothing like I expected.Dallas is so over football. Her dad has coached multiple college and high school football teams, taking them from the bottom to the top and then they move on to another school. Dallas&#8217; first boyfriend played football and when they broke up she was done, or so she thought. The first night at school she meets Carson who is all kinds of hot and leaves her wanting.Carson is having a hard time fitting in at Rusk. He&#8217;s a transfer so none of the guys respect him and he needs to be better if he wants to stay at the school without making his parents give up more than they already have. He needs a scholarship and he won&#8217;t get that from his grades. He knows there can be no distractions but running into Dallas turns everything upside down.I am honestly in love with this series now. Cora Carmack does not disappoint with her new series.Dallas and Carson were great characters to read about. Carson is sweet and dedicated. Even when he knows he&#8217;s not supposed to be with Dallas he finds a way to be with her in any way he can. I honestly loved their relationship. They study and do homework together, they watch movies and do normal couple things together which was adorable and made their relationship all the more believable.Both characters really grow from amazing characters to awesome characters. Where Dallas is scared to love and be vulnerable she learns to be herself and comes out of her shell, with the help of Carson of coarse. Carson thinks he&#8217;ll never be good enough but over time he learns to have more confidence within himself, which I mean who doesn&#8217;t love a hot confident funny guy? I know I do!I honestly loved this book. Everything about this story made everything so realistic and enjoyable. I loved the humor and constantly found myself laughing while reading. My heart would ache when things got hard and I could hardly put this amazing story down for a second.

Only a writer of Wallwork&#8217;s talent can create such a viscerally encompassing experience that left me with literal nightmares. His work is diverse, from his mythical collection, Quintessence of Dust, to the strange macabre noir of To Die Upon a Kiss, to this bizarro trio of horrific tales, so that every work is an evocative foray into the depths of human nature. His prose is organic and vibrant, painting emotions through body parts:&#8220;After a short drive up the path they were met at the door by an old man.

It&#8217;s not as though she had any reason to suspect that I was actually planning on f$%&ing; her son&#8217;s brains out that night.As much as the funny moments are hilarious and the time flew by what really stuck with me as I read were those tender and at times uncertain and awkward moments of first love and finding your place in the world and among your peers. &#8220;Maybe Someday Just not today.&#8221; ~ I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll understand one day when you find that one person you know you&#8217;re supposed to be with, you&#8217;ll do whatever you have to do in order to be with him. ~The letter and picture killed me. What can I say I&#8217;m a sap and Trip has some really good moves. The lessons on popularity and fitting in, the future, small towns and dealing with family were all spot on. A very strong opening with interesting characters to set up the series. I can&#8217;t wait to see what the uncertain future holds.\n",

Even with the same old young girl heroine who goes head strong and hell bent on saving the new world, id tecommend this book to dystopian fiction fans!  Not overdone, thankfully! A fesw situations made it feel like I've read this same plot before....but these were well thought out and much better written!  This authr has a gift a d I will be looking forward to reading more of ber work.\n",

Broken World was so touching and emotional because you go from Mia\\'s trauma to her trying to cope.  I love the way the story displays how there is no \"just bouncing back\" from being sexually assaulted.  Mia showed us how those demons come for you every day and how sometimes they best you. I was so in the moment with Broken World and hurt with Mia because she was surrounded by people but so alone and I understood her feelings.  I found myself wishing I could give her some of my courage and strength or even just to be there for her.  Thank you Lizzy for putting a great character\\'s voice on a strong subject and making it so that other peoples story may be heard through Mia\\'s.'"
